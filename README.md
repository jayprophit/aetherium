# README: World-Class Knowledge Base

Welcome to the world-class, production-ready knowledge-base platform. This system is designed for extensibility, modularity, and integration of knowledge from all genres and domains.

## Features
- FastAPI backend with plugin/tool system
- React frontend for chat, document browsing, and plugin UI
- Modular knowledge organization (enhancements, patents, ideas, theories, science, technologies, cross-genre)
- Ready for local and remote deployment (Docker, GitHub)
- CI/CD, security, and production standards

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Follow `/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` for structure and deployment
3. Add new knowledge modules in `/knowledge`
4. See `/modules/` for integrated business, AI, and technology modules

# Knowledge-Base Platform

A unified, extensible platform integrating all major business, technology, and AI features as core modules. All capabilities—including ERP, AI/ML, blockchain, device integration, and more—are part of the main system and share code, documentation, and data.

## Core Integrated Modules
- [ERP](/modules/erp/) — Enterprise Resource Planning (finance, HR, SCM, CRM, etc.)
- [AI/ML](/modules/ai/) — Analytics, inference, and automation *(coming soon)*
- [Blockchain/Web3](/modules/erp/contracts/) — Smart contracts, decentralized features
- [Device/IoT](/modules/erp/smart_devices/) — Smart device and edge integration
- [Documentation & Knowledge](/resources/documentation/docs/) — All docs and theory are cross-linked and actionable

## Architecture
- All modules live under `/modules/` as first-class, non-siloed features
- Shared libraries, infrastructure, and tests are accessible to all modules
- Documentation and navigation reflect this unified, modular structure

## Cross-Disciplinary Inspiration & Contribution
- The knowledge-base encourages the integration of inspiration and references from:
  - Theories, ideas, and scientific papers
  - Films, movies, TV series, anime, and animation
  - Books, comics, and audio books
  - Documentaries and cross-genre media
- Add relevant content and cross-link it with patents, modules, and documentation to enhance and advance the system.
- See `/knowledge/patents/README.md` for examples and contribution guidelines.

## Contributing New Data & Modules
- Add new business, AI, or technology modules under `/modules/`
- Add new documentation, theory, or knowledge to `/resources/documentation/docs/`
- Cross-link new content with existing modules for maximum integration
- See `/modules/erp/docs/architecture.md` for an example of module documentation

See `/modules/erp/`, `/resources/documentation/docs/`, and `/knowledge/patents/README.md` for details and cross-links.
