> **Main Files Policy:** This file is one of the main, critical files for the knowledge base. Any change to this file must be reflected in all other main files, both before and after any process. All main files are cross-linked and referenced. See [README.md](temp_reorg/robotics/advanced_system/README.md) for details.

> **Traceability:** All data inputs and amendments are timestamped for traceability and rollback. See also [memories.md](memories.md), [changelog.md](changelog.md), and [rollback.md](rollback.md).

# TODO List

> **IMPORTANT:** The following main files are critical and must be kept in sync. Any change to one must be reflected in all others, both before and after any process. All must be cross-linked and referenced:
> - [README.md](README.md)
> - [architecture.md](architecture.md)

This file tracks all next actions and outstanding tasks for the knowledge base. For full context, see also: [checklist.md](checklist.md), [plan.md](plan.md), [changelog.md](changelog.md).

## Immediate Next Actions
- [x] Run a deep analysis scan for undocumented data/components (see plan.md)
- [x] Add documentation/code for any uncovered data, ensuring cross-links and references
- [x] Add and cross-link documentation/code for AI/ML integration (see advanced_system/ai_ml_integration.md)
- [x] Add and cross-link documentation/code for blockchain integration (see advanced_system/blockchain_integration.md)
- [x] Add and cross-link documentation/code for sanskrit-style reorganization and universal improvements (see advanced_system/sanskrit_style_reorganization.md)
- [x] Verify there are no empty directories, duplicate files, or folders
- [x] Update all main files ([README.md](README.md), [architecture.md](architecture.md), [changelog.md](changelog.md), [memories.md](memories.md), [method.md](method.md), [plan.md](plan.md), [rollback.md](rollback.md), [system_design.md](system_design.md), [FIXME.md](FIXME.md), [checklist.md](checklist.md)) after each process
- [ ] Ongoing: Repo-wide verification/cleanup for gaps, broken links, orphaned files, deduplication, and documentation/code coverage for all advanced robotics features (quantum, nano, holographic, time crystal, AI/ML, blockchain, sanskrit-style, etc.)

## Ongoing
- [ ] Ongoing repo-wide verification/cleanup for gaps, broken links, orphaned files, deduplication, and documentation/code coverage for all advanced robotics features (quantum, nano, holographic, time crystal, etc.)
- [ ] Keep all documentation and code in sync with plan.md and changelog.md
- [ ] Ensure every process/feature is reflected in all main files
- [ ] Explicit cross-linking between all main and sub-files

This file tracks folders and files that need to be fixed, categorized by urgency. Items are addressed either immediately or scheduled for later, according to their importance.

## Urgent (fix straight away)
- [ ] Broken core system files
- [ ] Critical robotics/AI module errors
- [ ] Major documentation gaps in new modules
- [ ] [Multisensory Robotics Documentation](docs/robotics/advanced_system/multisensory_robotics.md) â€” use as reference for advanced robotics fixes

## Intermediate (mostly fixed, can finish later)
- [ ] Incomplete cross-links in robotics/AI docs
- [ ] Minor code/documentation errors in new fields of education modules
- [ ] Orphaned files (see scripts/verify_docs.py output)

## Less Urgent (can defer)
- [ ] Refactoring for code style consistency
- [ ] Additional examples for user guides
- [ ] Expanding advanced movement/interaction examples
