## MCP Instructions

This directory contains critical instructions and configuration files for the Master Control Program (MCP) of the knowledge base.

## Purpose
The MCP orchestrates the knowledge base's operations, including:
- Task planning and execution
- Memory management
- System monitoring and diagnostics
- Integration with external systems

## Files
- `plan.md`: The current plan of action for the knowledge base, including tasks and goals.
- `memories.md`: Important context and memories stored by the system.
- `method.md`: The methodology and protocols followed by the MCP.
- `rollback.md`: Procedures for rolling back changes in case of errors.
- `system_design.md`: The overall architecture and design of the knowledge base system.
- `architecture.md`: Detailed technical architecture.
- `FIXME.md`: Known issues and bugs that need attention.
- `TODO.md`: Upcoming tasks and feature ideas.
- `checklist.md`: Checklists for various operations.
- `notes.md`: General notes and observations.
- `current_goal.md`: The current primary goal of the knowledge base.
- `task_list.md`: A detailed list of tasks to be completed.

## Integration with Chat and Plan Data
The MCP instructions are designed to integrate seamlessly with the chat system and planning tools. This allows for:
- Real-time updates to plans based on user interactions
- Dynamic adjustment of tasks and goals
- Contextual memory recall during conversations
- Automated task execution and progress tracking

To ensure synchronization:
1. The MCP monitors the `plan.md` and `task_list.md` for changes and updates the in-memory representation accordingly.
2. Chat interactions can trigger updates to the plan or task list.
3. The MCP uses the `memories.md` file to store and retrieve context across sessions.

## Maintenance
Regularly review and update these files to reflect the current state of the knowledge base. Use the provided tools and scripts to automate synchronization where possible.
