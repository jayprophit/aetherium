# Scheduled Reviews

## Overview
This document outlines the schedule, methodology, and process for conducting regular reviews of the knowledge base content. Regular reviews are essential to maintain accuracy, relevance, machine readability, and constitutional alignment across all documentation.

## Review Schedule

### Weekly Reviews
- **Scope**: New content added in the past week
- **Focus**: Initial quality validation, link checking, formatting
- **Participants**: Content authors and at least one reviewer
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours
- **Documentation**: Brief summary in weekly review log

### Monthly Reviews
- **Scope**: All content modified in the past month
- **Focus**: Technical accuracy, cross-references, MCP compatibility
- **Participants**: Domain experts and knowledge base maintainers
- **Duration**: One day per month (last Friday)
- **Documentation**: Monthly review report with actionable items

### Quarterly Reviews
- **Scope**: Key documentation sections and frequently accessed content
- **Focus**: Accuracy, completeness, relevance, constitutional alignment
- **Participants**: Full knowledge base team and subject matter experts
- **Duration**: Three days per quarter (last week of quarter)
- **Documentation**: Quarterly review report with metrics and improvement plan

### Annual Comprehensive Review
- **Scope**: Entire knowledge base
- **Focus**: Strategic alignment, content pruning, major updates, architectural improvements
- **Participants**: All stakeholders including external reviewers
- **Duration**: Two weeks (scheduled at year-end)
- **Documentation**: Annual knowledge base status report and next-year plan

## Review Process

### Preparation Phase
1. **Content Inventory**: Generate list of content to be reviewed based on schedule
2. **Review Assignment**: Assign reviewers based on expertise and availability
3. **Pre-review Analysis**: Run automated checks for formatting, links, and structure
4. **Review Environment**: Prepare staging environment with latest content

### Review Phase
1. **Individual Review**: Reviewers assess assigned content using [quality checklist](quality_checklist.md)
2. **Collaborative Review**: Team discussion of findings and recommendations
3. **Machine Compatibility Testing**: Validate MCP/AI compatibility and vector embedding quality
4. **Constitutional Assessment**: Evaluate content against Anthropic principles

### Implementation Phase
1. **Issue Prioritization**: Categorize issues by severity and impact
2. **Content Updates**: Make necessary corrections and improvements
3. **Documentation**: Record all changes in changelog
4. **Validation**: Verify that changes resolve the identified issues
5. **Approval**: Final sign-off by knowledge base maintainers

### Follow-up Phase
1. **Metrics Collection**: Track key performance indicators for content quality
2. **Process Improvement**: Identify ways to improve the review process
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Distribute lessons learned to content creators
4. **Automation Enhancement**: Update automated tests based on common issues found

## Review Types

### Technical Accuracy Review
- Validation of technical concepts and code examples
- Verification of current best practices
- Confirmation of version compatibility
- Expert assessment of explanations and recommendations

### Content Structure Review
- Adherence to templates and formatting standards
- Proper organization of information
- Appropriate use of headings, lists, and tables
- Consistency across similar document types

### MCP Compatibility Review
- Validation of machine-readable structure
- Assessment of metadata completeness and accuracy
- Testing with MCP parsers and AI systems
- Verification of knowledge unit identification

### Constitutional Alignment Review
- Evaluation against helpfulness principle
- Assessment of harmlessness considerations
- Verification of honesty and appropriate uncertainty
- Analysis of neutrality and accessibility

## Review Tools and Resources

### Automated Tools
- Link validators for checking internal and external references
- Markdown linters for formatting consistency
- JSON schema validators for metadata
- Readability analyzers for content complexity assessment
- Vector embedding quality assessment tools

### Review Templates
- [Quality Checklist](quality_checklist.md)
- [Content Review Form](../templates/review_template.md)
- [Constitutional Assessment Matrix](../anthropic/templates/constitutional_assessment_template.md)
- [Technical Accuracy Checklist](../templates/technical_review_template.md)

### Tracking and Management
- GitHub Issues for tracking identified problems
- Pull Requests for proposed changes
- Project boards for review coordination
- Review metrics dashboard for progress tracking

## Special Review Considerations

### Critical Documentation
- Core workflow steps require two independent reviewers
- Model documentation requires subject matter expert validation
- Integration points need cross-team validation
- User-facing guides require usability testing

### Legacy Content
- Prioritize review of older content (>1 year without review)
- Assess for deprecation or archiving if no longer relevant
- Consider complete rewrites for significantly outdated material
- Validate historical accuracy and proper versioning

### New Content Types
- First examples of new document types require extra scrutiny
- New templates should be reviewed for both human and machine readability
- Pilot testing with target audiences before full integration
- Feedback collection and iterative improvement

## Review Metrics and KPIs

### Quality Metrics
- Number of issues found per document
- Severity distribution of issues
- Time to resolution for identified problems
- Consistency score across similar documents

### Process Metrics
- Review completion rate against schedule
- Time spent in each review phase
- Number of documents reviewed per time period
- Reviewer participation and contribution

### Impact Metrics
- User feedback on reviewed content
- MCP compatibility score improvements
- Constitutional alignment score trends
- Knowledge base usage statistics for reviewed content
