# Vertical Scaling in System Design

## Overview

Vertical scaling (scaling up) means adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single server to improve performance. It is often the first step in scaling a system but has practical and economic limits.

## Advantages
- Simple to implement
- No application changes required
- Useful for monolithic systems

## Disadvantages
- Hardware limits
- Single point of failure
- Downtime required for upgrades
- Cost increases rapidly with scale

## Example: Upgrading a Database Server
- Add more RAM/CPU to the existing database server
- Move to a more powerful cloud instance (e.g., AWS EC2)

## When to Use
- Small to medium workloads
- Applications not designed for distributed scaling

## Best Practices
- Monitor resource utilization
- Plan for horizontal scaling as growth continues
- Use cloud providers for flexible scaling
