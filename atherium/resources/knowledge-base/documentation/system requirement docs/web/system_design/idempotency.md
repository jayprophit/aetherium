# Idempotency in System Design

## Overview

Idempotency is a property of certain operations in which performing the operation multiple times has the same effect as performing it once. It is critical for reliability in distributed systems, especially for APIs and message processing.

## Why Idempotency Matters
- Prevents duplicate processing (e.g., payment, order creation)
- Enables safe retries in case of network failures
- Simplifies error handling and recovery

## Implementation Strategies
- Use idempotency keys (unique request identifiers)
- Store operation results and check for duplicates
- Design APIs to be idempotent by default (e.g., PUT, DELETE)

## Example: Idempotent Payment API (Python Flask)
```python
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)
processed = set()
@app.route('/pay', methods=['POST'])
def pay():
    idempotency_key = request.headers.get('Idempotency-Key')
    if idempotency_key in processed:
        return 'Already processed', 200
    processed.add(idempotency_key)
    # Process payment logic here
    return 'Payment processed', 201
```

## Best Practices
- Require idempotency keys for critical operations (e.g., payments)
- Document idempotency behavior in API docs
- Use idempotent HTTP methods where possible
