# Blob Storage in System Design

## Overview

Blob storage (Binary Large Object storage) is used to store unstructured data such as images, videos, documents, and backups. It is a fundamental component for scalable, distributed systems and is often used in cloud architectures.

## Key Characteristics
- Stores unstructured data as objects/blobs
- Highly scalable and durable
- Supports large file sizes
- Accessed via HTTP APIs
- Common in cloud architectures (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage)

## Use Cases
- Media storage (images, videos, audio)
- Document management
- Data backups and archives
- Big data analytics
- Static website hosting

## Implementation Example: AWS S3 (Python)
```python
import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
# Upload
s3.upload_file('myfile.jpg', 'mybucket', 'myfile.jpg')
# Download
s3.download_file('mybucket', 'myfile.jpg', 'myfile_downloaded.jpg')
```

## Implementation Example: Azure Blob Storage (Python)
```python
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string('your_connection_string')
container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client('mycontainer')
with open('myfile.txt', 'rb') as data:
    container_client.upload_blob(name='myfile.txt', data=data)
```

## Best Practices
- Use unique object keys for organization
- Enable versioning for critical data
- Set appropriate access controls (private/public)
- Use lifecycle policies for automatic cleanup
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
