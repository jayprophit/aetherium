# Sharding in System Design

## Overview

Sharding is a database architecture pattern that distributes data across multiple servers (shards) to improve scalability and performance.

## Sharding Strategies
- **Range-based:** Split by value ranges (e.g., user_id 1-1000)
- **Hash-based:** Use a hash function to assign data to shards
- **Directory-based:** Use a lookup table to map data to shards

## Advantages
- Horizontal scalability
- Fault isolation
- Improved performance for large datasets

## Challenges
- Complex queries across shards
- Rebalancing data
- Increased operational complexity

## Example: MongoDB Sharding
```js
sh.enableSharding("mydb")
sh.shardCollection("mydb.users", { "user_id": 1 })
```

## Best Practices
- Choose shard key carefully
- Monitor shard balance
- Automate failover and recovery
