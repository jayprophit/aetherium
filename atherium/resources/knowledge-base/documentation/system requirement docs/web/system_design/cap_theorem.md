# CAP Theorem in System Design

## Overview

The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

## Properties
- **Consistency:** Every read receives the most recent write
- **Availability:** Every request receives a (non-error) response
- **Partition Tolerance:** System continues to operate despite network partitions

## Real-World Examples
- **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):** HBase, MongoDB (with write concern)
- **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance):** Couchbase, DynamoDB
- **CA (Consistency + Availability):** Single-node relational databases

## Implications
- Trade-offs are inevitable in distributed systems
- Choose based on application requirements

## Best Practices
- Understand your application's needs
- Design for graceful degradation
- Monitor for network partitions
