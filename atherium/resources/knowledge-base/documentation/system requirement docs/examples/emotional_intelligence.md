# Emotional Intelligence and Self-Awareness System

[![Tests](https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge-base/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge-base/actions)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/emotional-ai/badge/?version=latest)](https://emotional-ai.readthedocs.io/)

A comprehensive implementation of emotional intelligence and self-awareness capabilities for AI systems, featuring emotion modeling, introspection, empathy, and emotional memory.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Full Emotional Spectrum**: Models 24+ human emotions with varying intensities using Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) model
- **Neural Network-Based**: Deep learning models for emotion processing and regulation
- **Self-Reflection**: Metacognitive monitoring and introspection capabilities
- **Social Intelligence**: Empathy, perspective-taking, and social awareness
- **Emotional Memory**: Long-term storage and retrieval of emotional experiences
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Emotionally-intelligent responses and decision-making
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible architecture for custom implementations

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```python
from emotional_intelligence import EmotionalAISystem

# Initialize the emotional AI system
ai = EmotionalAISystem()

# Process emotional input
response = ai.process_emotional_input(
    text="I'm feeling really excited about this project!",
    context="user_feedback"
)

# Get emotional state
current_state = ai.get_emotional_state()
print(f"Current emotional state: {current_state}")
```

## Core Components

### Emotion Recognition
- Text-based emotion analysis
- Voice tone analysis
- Facial expression recognition
- Physiological signal processing

### Emotion Generation
- Context-appropriate emotional responses
- Mood-adaptive behavior
- Empathetic interactions

### Self-Awareness
- Metacognitive monitoring
- Introspection and self-reflection
- Emotional state tracking

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Emotion Models
```python
from emotional_intelligence.models import EmotionModel

# Create a custom emotion model
custom_model = EmotionModel(
    emotion_dimensions=3,  # VAD model
    hidden_layers=[64, 32],
    learning_rate=0.001
)

# Train on custom dataset
custom_model.train(training_data, epochs=50)
```

### Emotional Memory
```python
# Store emotional experience
ai.memory.store_experience(
    event="project_meeting",
    emotion={"valence": 0.8, "arousal": 0.6, "dominance": 0.7},
    context="team_collaboration"
)

# Retrieve similar emotional memories
memories = ai.memory.retrieve_similar(
    query="successful collaboration",
    emotion_profile={"valence": 0.7, "arousal": 0.5}
)
```

## Integration

### With Chatbots
```python
from emotional_intelligence.integration import ChatbotIntegration

class EmpatheticChatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.emotional_ai = EmotionalAISystem()
        self.chatbot = Chatbot()
        
    def respond(self, user_input):
        # Analyze emotional content
        emotional_context = self.emotional_ai.analyze(user_input)
        
        # Generate emotionally appropriate response
        response = self.chatbot.generate_response(
            user_input,
            emotional_context=emotional_context
        )
        
        # Update emotional state
        self.emotional_ai.update_state(emotional_context)
        
        return response
```

## Best Practices

1. **Data Privacy**: Always handle emotional data with care and comply with privacy regulations
2. **Bias Mitigation**: Regularly audit emotion models for biases
3. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate when emotional AI is being used
4. **User Control**: Allow users to opt-out of emotional analysis
