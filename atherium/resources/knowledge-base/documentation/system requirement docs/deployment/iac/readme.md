# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

> **Note:** This is a reference page for the IaC documentation. For the complete guide, please see the [main IaC documentation](../../../../iac/README.md).

## Overview

This directory contains documentation and references for the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation in the knowledge base project. The IaC implementation follows best practices for managing cloud and on-premises infrastructure using code.

## Documentation Sections

1. [Main IaC Guide](../../../../iac/README.md) - Comprehensive guide to managing infrastructure as code
2. [Terraform Modules](./modules/README.md) - Reusable infrastructure components
3. [Environments](./environments/README.md) - Environment-specific configurations
4. [CI/CD Integration](./ci-cd/README.md) - Integration with continuous integration and deployment

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Terraform 1.0+
- AWS/GCP/Azure CLI configured
- Required provider credentials

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan changes
terraform plan

# Apply changes
terraform apply
```

## Best Practices

- Use remote state with locking
- Implement proper state isolation between environments
- Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles
- Use variables and outputs effectively
- Document all modules and resources
