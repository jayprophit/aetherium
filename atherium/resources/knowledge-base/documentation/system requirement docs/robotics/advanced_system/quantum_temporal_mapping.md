# Quantum Temporal Mapping in Advanced Robotic Systems

## Overview

Quantum temporal mapping enables real-time analysis and prediction of past, present, and future timelines using quantum models. This empowers advanced robotics with superior planning, anticipation, and decision-making abilities.

## Key Concepts
- **Timeline Mapping:** Quantum algorithms for mapping multiple timelines
- **Prediction Models:** Assess probable outcomes for decisions
- **Temporal Awareness:** Real-time adaptation to temporal changes

## Example Implementation

```python
class QuantumTemporalMapper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.timelines = {};
    def map_timeline(self, timestamp, state):
        self.timelines[timestamp] = state
    def predict_future(self, current_state):
        # Placeholder for quantum prediction logic
        return "Predicted future state (TBD)":
# Commentary: Maps and predicts system states across time.
```
