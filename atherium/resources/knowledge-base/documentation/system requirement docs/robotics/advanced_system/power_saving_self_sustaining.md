# Power-Saving and Self-Sustaining Systems

## Overview
Describes adaptive energy utilization, quantum/zero-point energy stabilization, and biosynthetic energy for perpetual operation in advanced robotics.

## Adaptive Energy Utilization
- Predictive algorithms for power optimization
- Harvesting unused energy

## Zero-Point Energy Stabilizer
- Quantum energy balancing
- Theoretical and speculative models

## Biosynthetic Energy
- Simulated biological energy generation (e.g., photosynthesis-inspired)

## Cross-links
