# Edge Analytics

This document provides an overview of edge analytics in the knowledge base system.

## Overview
Edge analytics involves processing data at the edge of the network, near the source of the data. This reduces latency and bandwidth usage.

## Key Features
- Real-time data processing
- Reduced latency for critical applications
- Bandwidth optimization
- Enhanced privacy and security

## Use Cases
- Industrial IoT: Predictive maintenance and anomaly detection
- Smart Cities: Traffic management and environmental monitoring
- Healthcare: Real-time patient monitoring

## Getting Started
To implement edge analytics in your application:
1. Deploy edge nodes with sufficient processing capabilities
2. Install the knowledge base edge analytics module
3. Configure data sources and processing pipelines
4. Define analytics rules and thresholds

For detailed instructions, see the [Edge Analytics Deployment Guide](../deployment/edge_analytics.md).
