# Blockchain Systems

This directory contains the implementation and documentation for blockchain-related functionality in the knowledge base.

## Overview

The blockchain system provides decentralized, secure, and transparent data storage and transaction capabilities. Key features include:

- Smart contract development and deployment
- Distributed ledger technology
- Cryptography and security
- Consensus mechanisms
- Token standards and digital assets

## Core Components

### Smart Contracts
- **Ethereum**: Solidity-based smart contracts
- **Hyperledger**: Permissioned blockchain solutions
- **Custom**: Protocol-specific implementations

### Cryptography
- Public/Private key management
- Digital signatures
- Hash functions
- Zero-knowledge proofs

### Network
- Peer-to-peer communication
- Node management
- Consensus protocols (PoW, PoS, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Solidity compiler (solc)
- Web3.js or Ethers.js
- Ganache (for local development)

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
truffle compile

# Run tests
truffle test
```

## Usage

### Deploying a Smart Contract
```javascript
const contract = await MyContract.new();
await contract.initialize(initialParams);
```

### Interacting with Contracts
```javascript
const result = await contract.someMethod(params);
const value = await contract.someValue();
```

## Security Considerations

- Always audit smart contracts before deployment
- Follow best practices for secure contract development
- Use established libraries when possible
- Implement proper access control
