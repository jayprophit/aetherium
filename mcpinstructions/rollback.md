# Rollback Procedures

> **IMPORTANT:** The following main files are critical and must be kept in sync. Any change to one must be reflected in all others, both before and after any process. All must be cross-linked and referenced:
> - [README.md](README.md)
> - [architecture.md](architecture.md)
> - [changelog.md](changelog.md)
> - [memories.md](memories.md)
> - [method.md](method.md)
> - [plan.md](plan.md)
> - [rollback.md](rollback.md)
> - [system_design.md](system_design.md)
> - [FIXME.md](FIXME.md)
> - [TODO.md](TODO.md)
> - [checklist.md](checklist.md)
>
> **Validation:** All data and code must be validated for correct formatting and correctness at every step.

## Overview
This document outlines procedures for rolling back changes to the knowledge base when necessary. These procedures are designed to maintain data integrity and provide a reliable mechanism for reverting to previous stable states. Special attention is given to robotics, MLOps, and emotional intelligence components.

## Pre-Rollback Checklist

1. **Identify Impact**
   - Determine which components are affected (documentation, code, models, configurations)
   - Check dependent systems and services
   - Verify backup availability

2. **Communication Plan**
   - Notify stakeholders about the planned rollback
   - Schedule maintenance window if needed
   - Document rollback reason and expected duration

3. **Backup Current State**
   - Create a backup tag: `git tag backup-pre-rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)`
   - Push tag: `git push origin <tag_name>`

## Standard Rollback Procedures

### 1. Git-Based Rollback (Individual Files)

#### For Minor Changes
```bash
# View commit history for a specific file
git log --follow -- path/to/file.md

# Revert a specific file to a previous commit
git checkout <commit_hash> -- path/to/file.md

# Commit the rollback
git commit -m "Rollback: Reverted file.md to previous version"
```

#### For Multiple Files
```bash
# Revert the entire repository to a specific commit
git revert <commit_hash>

# Or reset to a specific commit (use with caution)
git reset --hard <commit_hash>
git push --force  # Only use when absolutely necessary
```

### 2. Content Versioning Rollback

If specific content versions are maintained in the documentation:

1. Locate the previous version in the file history
2. Copy the content from the historical version
3. Replace the current content
4. Update references and metadata as needed
5. Document the rollback in the changelog

### 3. Component-Specific Rollback Procedures

### 1. Robotics Components

#### Rollback Robot Firmware
```bash
# Check available firmware versions
robot-cli firmware list

# Rollback to previous version
robot-cli firmware rollback <version>

# Verify robot status
robot-cli status
```

#### Revert Robot Configuration
```bash
# List configuration history
robot-cli config history

# Revert to previous configuration
robot-cli config rollback <version>
```

### 2. MLOps Pipeline

#### Model Rollback
```python
# Using MLflow for model versioning
import mlflow

# List available model versions
client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()
model_versions = client.search_model_versions(f"name='model_name'")

# Transition model stage
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="model_name",
    version=previous_version,
    stage="Production"
):
```

#### Kubernetes Deployment Rollback
```bash
# List deployment history
kubectl rollout history deployment/ml-service

# Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/ml-service
```

### 3. Emotional Intelligence Module

#### Emotion Model Rollback
```python
# Revert to previous emotion model version
from emotion_models import EmotionModel

model = EmotionModel.load_version(version='previous_stable')
model.deploy()
```

### 4. Emergency Rollback

In case of critical failures or data corruption:

1. Temporarily take documentation offline (if web-hosted)
2. Create a backup of the current state
3. Execute the appropriate git rollback command
4. Verify the integrity of the restored state
5. Bring documentation back online
6. Document the incident and resolution

## Rollback Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Severity | Recommended Action | Approval Required |
|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Typo or minor error | Low | Single file git checkout | None |
| Incorrect information | Medium | Targeted file reversion | Document owner |
| Broken links/references | Medium | Fix forward or revert commit | Document owner |
| Data loss or corruption | High | Full emergency rollback | Project lead |
| Accidental deletion | High | Git revert or repository restore | Project lead |

## Pre-Rollback Checklist

- [ ] Identify the scope of the issue (files affected)
- [ ] Determine the appropriate rollback method
- [ ] Backup current state before executing rollback
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of planned rollback
- [ ] Schedule rollback during low-activity period if possible
- [ ] Prepare verification tests for post-rollback functionality

## Post-Rollback Verification

- [ ] Verify content integrity after rollback
- [ ] Check all internal references and links
- [ ] Test any affected functionality
- [ ] Update changelog with rollback details
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of completed rollback
- [ ] Document lessons learned to prevent similar issues

## Automated Rollback Scripts

### Future Implementation
Automated rollback scripts will be developed to simplify the rollback process for common scenarios. These scripts will be stored in the `scripts/` directory and documented here when available.

## Main Directory Update Points

After every rollback or major process, the following files must be reviewed and updated to maintain traceability:
- [README.md](README.md)
- [architecture.md](architecture.md)
- [changelog.md](changelog.md)
- [memories.md](memories.md)
- [method.md](method.md)
- [plan.md](plan.md)
- [rollback.md](rollback.md)
- [system_design.md](system_design.md)
- [FIXME.md](FIXME.md)
- [TODO.md](TODO.md)
- [checklist.md](checklist.md)

Rollback procedures must always include updating these files. See [plan.md](plan.md) and [checklist.md](checklist.md) for the update workflow and status tracking.
