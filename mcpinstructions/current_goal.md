## Current Goal
Repo-wide deep analysis scan, documentation/code for any uncovered data, and explicit updating of all main files after each process, strictly enforcing cross-linking/validation requirements

- The strict requirement that any change to one main file must be reflected in all others, before and after any process, is now implemented and enforced via prominent cross-linking and validation notes in all main files. This is now an active, enforced policy in the knowledge base.
- New note: User requested a new full repo-wide deep analysis scan for undocumented data/components, with explicit instruction to add documentation and code for any data that hasn't been provided with documentation and code, ensuring links and references are present. All main files ([README.md], [architecture.md], [changelog.md], [memories.md], [method.md], [plan.md], [rollback.md], [system_design.md], [FIXME.md], [TODO.md], [checklist.md]) must be updated after each process.
- [ ] Run a new deep analysis scan of all directories for undocumented data/components; add documentation and code for any uncovered data, ensuring all links and references are present
- [ ] Run a full repo-wide verification/cleanup for gaps, broken links, orphaned files, and errors
- [ ] Update all main files ([README.md], [architecture.md], [changelog.md], [memories.md], [method.md], [plan.md], [rollback.md], [system_design.md], [FIXME.md], [TODO.md], [checklist.md]) after each process
- [ ] Implement and document comprehensive improvements for advanced robotic systems as specified in the latest user request (perception, movement, communication, intelligence, UI/UX, energy, security, navigation, modularity, learning, collaboration, ethics, disaster recovery, testing, compliance, etc.); ensure code, documentation, cross-linking, deduplication, merging, and error fixing for all new data
- [ ] Implement and document all missing components, enhancements, and additional functionalities from the advanced robotic system implementation plan provided by the user, ensuring all documentation/code is present, all links/references are correct, and no empty/duplicate files or folders remain

- New note: Advanced connectivity/communication framework (modems, satellites, mobile/phone providers, VOIP, 1G-6G+, Bluetooth, WiFi, radio, subsonic, telephonic, morse code, encryption, etc.) and comprehensive improvement framework for speculative abilities (supersonic, hypersonic, consciousness, telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis) are now fully documented, cross-linked, and monitored for future enhancements. No empty, duplicate, or undocumented files/folders remain as of July 1, 2025.
- New note: User provided a detailed advanced robotic system implementation plan (architecture, modules, hardware, software, security, ethics, disaster recovery, swarm intelligence, etc.) and requested that all missing components, enhancements, and additional functionalities be implemented, documented, and integrated. All links, references, deduplication, and error fixing must be ensured.

- New note: Deep analysis scan and repo-wide verification/cleanup has been initiated as of July 1, 2025; directory and codebase search for undocumented, missing, or incomplete components is in progress, with no critical gaps found so far. Ongoing monitoring and targeted documentation/code additions will continue as new gaps are discovered.
