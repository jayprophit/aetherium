# Knowledge Base - Memory Tracking

## Purpose
This file serves as a persistent memory record across chat sessions, tracking changes and decisions made in the knowledge base. By maintaining this record, new chat sessions can quickly understand the context and history of previous work.

## Critical Main Files

> **IMPORTANT:** The following main files are critical and must be kept in sync. Any change to one must be reflected in all others, both before and after any process. All must be cross-linked and referenced:
> - [README.md](README.md)
> - [architecture.md](architecture.md)
> - [changelog.md](changelog.md)
> - [memories.md](memories.md)
> - [method.md](method.md)
> - [plan.md](plan.md)
> - [rollback.md](rollback.md)
> - [system_design.md](system_design.md)
> - [FIXME.md](FIXME.md)
> - [TODO.md](TODO.md)
> - [checklist.md](checklist.md)
>
> **Validation:** All data and code must be validated for correct formatting and correctness at every step.

## Main Documentation Links

- [README](./README.md) - Overview and introduction to the knowledge base
- [Architecture](./architecture.md) - System architecture and structural design
- [Changelog](./changelog.md) - Record of all changes to the knowledge base
- [Plan](./plan.md) - Current development and maintenance plan
- [Rollback](./rollback.md) - Procedures for reverting changes
- [System Design](./system_design.md) - Detailed system design specifications

## Recent Session History

### Session: 2025-07-01

**Key Activities:**
- Conducted a full deep analysis scan of all directories for undocumented data/components
- Added documentation and code for all uncovered data, ensuring cross-links and references
- Explicitly updated all main files ([README.md], [architecture.md], [changelog.md], [memories.md], [method.md], [plan.md], [rollback.md], [system_design.md], [FIXME.md], [TODO.md], [checklist.md]) after each process
- All main files are now mandatory update points after every process
- Maintained full traceability and consistency across the knowledge base

### Session: 2025-06-30

**Key Activities:**
- Fixed Jupyter notebook parsing issues in `tutorials/quantum_circuit_optimization_tutorial.ipynb` and `tutorials/device_control_ai_tutorial.ipynb`
- Identified cross-contamination issues between notebooks: methods from device control notebook were incorrectly present in quantum circuit notebook
- Noted that several fixes are still needed before the notebooks are fully functional:
  - Remove misplaced methods
  - Complete the implementation of `optimize()` method
  - Fix escape character issues
  - Fix duplicated metadata
- Created this `memories.md` file to track changes and maintain continuity between sessions

**Pending Tasks:**
- Complete fixes for both Jupyter notebooks
- Continue work on unified multi-modal recognition system
- Update all cross-references in documentation

## How to Use This File

1. **At the start of each session:**
   - Review the most recent session history to understand current context
   - Note which tasks were completed and which remain pending

2. **During each session:**
   - Keep track of major decisions and changes
   - Document any new insights or approaches

3. **At the end of each session:**
   - Add a new dated entry under "Recent Session History"
   - List key activities completed
   - Note any pending tasks for the next session
   - Include links to any newly created or significantly modified files

By maintaining this memory file, we ensure that work can continue seamlessly across multiple chat sessions without losing context or repeating work.
