## Main Directory Update Points

After every process or major update, the following files must be reviewed and updated as a set to ensure consistency and traceability:
- [README.md](README.md)
- [architecture.md](architecture.md)
- [changelog.md](changelog.md)
- [memories.md](memories.md)
- [method.md](method.md)
