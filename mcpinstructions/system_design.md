## System Design

### Overview

The knowledge base is designed as a modular, scalable system with the following components:

### Core Modules
- **Data Ingestion**: Handles data from various sources.
- **Processing Engine**: Processes and analyzes data.
- **Storage**: Manages data storage with support for multiple backends.
- **API**: Provides a RESTful interface for interacting with the system.
- **UI**: A modern web interface for users.

### Deployment Architecture
- **Microservices**: Each core module is deployed as a separate microservice.
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for easy deployment.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.

### High Availability
- The system is designed for 99.9% uptime with redundancy at every level.

### Security
- End-to-end encryption and role-based access control.

For detailed deployment instructions, see the [Deployment Guide](../../resources/guides/deployment_guide.md).

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Updates

2. **Content Modification**: Make changes → Update references → Run auto_update_all.bat → GitHub push
3. **Content Deprecation**: Mark as deprecated → Add migration path → Update references → Run auto_update_all.bat → GitHub push
4. **Plan Synchronization**: Update brain plan → Automatic sync via script or GitHub Actions → Knowledge base plan updated
5. **Constitutional Review**: Review against Anthropic principles → Update metadata → Document in changelog

### Quality Assurance
- **Link Validation**: Automated checks for broken internal and external links via GitHub Actions
