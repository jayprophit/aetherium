# Quantum AI and Time Crystals: Vision & Roadmap

## Vision
Integrate quantum-inspired AI features into the knowledge-base, leveraging concepts from quantum computing, time crystals, and advanced physics. This will enable:
- Quantum-inspired search and reasoning
- Simulated time crystal-based memory and scheduling
- Theoretical quantum plugin execution

## Roadmap
1. **Quantum Search**: Use quantum algorithms (simulated) for faster, more creative retrieval.
2. **Time Crystal Memory**: Implement a scheduler that mimics time crystal periodicity for plugin/tool execution.
3. **Quantum Plugins**: Allow plugins to declare quantum properties (superposition, entanglement, etc.) for advanced orchestration.
4. **External Data**: Integrate with arXiv, quantum research APIs, and your knowledge-base for real-time science updates.
