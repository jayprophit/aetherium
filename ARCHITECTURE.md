# World-Class Knowledge Base: System Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the architecture, structure, and design principles of the knowledge-base platform, ensuring it is production-ready, extensible, and world-class.

## Directory Structure
- `/backend` — FastAPI backend, plugin system, document indexing, vector search, LLM integration
- `/frontend` — React frontend, chat UI, document browser, plugin UI, user management
- `/knowledge` — Core knowledge modules, enhancements, patents, ideas, theories, science, technologies, and cross-genre sources
    - `/enhancements` — Improvements, optimizations, and new features
    - `/advancements` — State-of-the-art methods, research, and breakthroughs
    - `/patents` — Patent summaries, links, and analyses
    - `/ideas` — Novel concepts, proposals, and creative thoughts
    - `/theories` — Scientific, technical, and speculative theories
    - `/science` — Scientific knowledge, discoveries, and principles
    - `/technologies` — Technologies, protocols, and engineering
    - `/cross_genre` — Knowledge from films, movies, books, magazines, comics, audio books, anime, cartoons, TV series, etc.

## System Design
- Modular, extensible, and API-driven
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with vector search and LLM
- Plugin/tool system for extensibility
- CI/CD ready, Dockerized, and GitHub integrated
- Local and remote deployment support

## Standards
- Follows best practices for code, documentation, and security
- Ready for world-class production use
- Designed for continuous improvement and expansion
