# GraphQL in System Design

## Overview

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. Developed by Facebook, it's an alternative to REST for building flexible and efficient APIs.

## Key Concepts
- **Schema:** Defines types and relationships
- **Query:** Request for data
- **Mutation:** Request to modify data
- **Resolver:** Function that returns data for a field

## Example: GraphQL Query
```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: Python GraphQL Server (Ariadne)
```python
from ariadne import QueryType, make_executable_schema, graphql_sync
from ariadne.constants import PLAYGROUND_HTML
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

type_defs = """"
type Query {
  hello: String!
}
""""
query = QueryType()
@query.field("hello")
def resolve_hello(*_):
    return "Hello, world!"
schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, query)

app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route("/graphql", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def graphql_server():
    data = request.get_json()
    success, result = graphql_sync(schema, data, context_value=request, debug=True)
    return jsonify(result)
```

## Best Practices
- Use strong typing in schemas
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Batch requests to minimize round-trips
- Use persisted queries for security
