# Microservices Architecture

## Overview

Microservices architecture structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability.

## Key Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Decentralized data management
- Independent deployment
- API-driven communication (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)

## Advantages
- Scalability and flexibility
- Fault isolation
- Technology diversity

## Challenges
- Distributed system complexity
- Network latency and reliability
- Data consistency
- Deployment and monitoring

## Implementation Example: Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  user-service:
    image: user-service:latest
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  order-service:
    image: order-service:latest
    ports:
      - "5001:5001"
```

## Best Practices
- Use API gateways for routing and security
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Implement service discovery
