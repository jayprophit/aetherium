# API Gateway in System Design

## Overview

An API gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for APIs in a microservices architecture. It handles routing, security, rate limiting, and protocol translation.

## Key Functions
- Request routing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Load balancing
- Protocol translation (REST, gRPC, WebSockets)

## Example: Kong API Gateway (Docker Compose)
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  kong:
    image: kong:latest
    environment:
      - KONG_DATABASE=off
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
      - "8443:8443"
```

## Best Practices
- Centralize authentication and security
- Monitor and log all API traffic
- Use plugins for extensibility
- Implement fallback and circuit breaker patterns
