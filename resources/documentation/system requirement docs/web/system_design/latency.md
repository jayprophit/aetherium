# Latency in System Design

## Overview

Latency is the time delay experienced in a system, typically measured as the time between a client request and the corresponding server response. Minimizing latency is crucial for user experience and system performance.

## Causes of Latency
- Network propagation delays
- DNS resolution
- Server processing time
- Database queries
- Application logic
- Geographical distance

## Measuring Latency
- **Ping:** Measures round-trip time (RTT)
- **Traceroute:** Identifies hops and bottlenecks
- **Application Metrics:** End-to-end timing in code

## Mitigation Strategies
- Use CDNs to cache content closer to users
- Optimize DNS and TCP connection setup
- Reduce server processing time
- Use efficient database queries and indexes
- Deploy servers in multiple regions

## Example: Measure Latency in Python
```python
import time
import requests
start = time.time()
requests.get('https://example.com')
print('Latency:', time.time() - start)
```
