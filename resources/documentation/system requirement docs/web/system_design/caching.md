# Caching in System Design

## Overview

Caching is the process of storing copies of data in a temporary storage location for faster retrieval. It is a critical technique for improving performance and scalability in distributed systems.

## Types of Caches
- **In-memory cache:** (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
- **Distributed cache:** Shared across multiple nodes
- **CDN cache:** Edge caching for static assets

## Caching Strategies
- **Write-through:** Data is written to cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-back:** Data is written to cache first, then to database asynchronously
- **Cache-aside:** Application loads data into cache on demand

## Example: Python with Redis
```python
import redis
cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
cache.set('key', 'value')
print(cache.get('key'))
```

## Best Practices
- Set appropriate eviction policies (LRU, LFU)
- Monitor cache hit/miss rates
- Invalidate cache when data changes
