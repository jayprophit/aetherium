# Advanced Engineering AI System

This module implements an AI system with the knowledge and reasoning abilities of a professional engineer with 100+ years of experience, integrating all science, engineering, mathematics, patents, and future concepts.

## Features
- Modular architecture for data, image, and information access
- Knowledge graph for representing all engineering/scientific/patent knowledge
- Reasoning and query system for answering complex, cross-disciplinary questions
- Continuous learning and knowledge update mechanisms

## Architecture
- **Knowledge Access**: API, database, and web scraping integration ([knowledge_access.py](../../src/advanced_engineering_ai/knowledge_access.py))
- **Knowledge Graph**: Graph structure for concepts and relationships ([knowledge_graph.py](../../src/advanced_engineering_ai/knowledge_graph.py))
- **AI System**: Query handling, reasoning, and integration ([ai_system.py](../../src/advanced_engineering_ai/ai_system.py))

## Example Usage
```python
from advanced_engineering_ai import AdvancedEngineeringAI
ai = AdvancedEngineeringAI()
output = ai.handle_query("Engineering")
print(output)
```

## Extensibility
- Add new data sources, APIs, or knowledge domains by extending the modules.
