# Knowledge Base Assistant Web Deployment

This project is a cross-platform AI assistant web app built with React. It supports chat, code generation, and multimodal features.

## Deploying to Netlify

1. Ensure dependencies are installed:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the app:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
3. Deploy to Netlify (or Vercel):
   - Use the `build` folder as the publish directory.

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

## Features
