# Quantum Entanglement

## Overview

Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by large distances.

## Key Concepts

### Entangled States

An example of a maximally entangled two-qubit state (Bell state):

$$|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$$

### Bell's Theorem

Bell's theorem shows that no physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics:

$$|S| \leq 2 \text{ (Classical) vs } |S| \leq 2\sqrt{2} \text{ (Quantum)}$$

### Quantum Nonlocality

Entanglement leads to nonlocal correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics, as demonstrated by violations of Bell's inequalities.

## Applications
