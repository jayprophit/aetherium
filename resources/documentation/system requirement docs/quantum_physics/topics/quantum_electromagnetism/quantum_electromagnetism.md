# Quantum Electromagnetism

## Overview

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is the relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics. It describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved.

## Key Concepts

### Fundamental Principles

- **Gauge Invariance**: QED is a U(1) gauge theory
- **Virtual Particles**: Mediate the electromagnetic force
- **Renormalization**: Technique to handle infinities in calculations

### Mathematical Formulation

The QED Lagrangian is given by:

$$\mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m)\psi - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$$

Where:
- $\psi$ is the electron field
- $D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ieA_\mu$ is the covariant derivative
- $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$ is the electromagnetic field tensor

### Feynman Diagrams

Graphical representation of particle interactions in QED:
- Vertices represent interactions
- Lines represent particle propagators
- Loops represent virtual particles

## Applications

- Precision tests of quantum mechanics
- Particle physics experiments
- Quantum computing with trapped ions
- Quantum optics
- Semiconductor physics

## Experimental Verification

- Anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron
- Lamb shift in hydrogen
- Casimir effect
- Delbr√ºck scattering

## Relation to Other Theories

- Foundation of the Standard Model
- Precursor to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
- Connection to condensed matter physics (e.g., superconductivity)

## Current Research and Open Questions

- Strong-field QED
- High-precision tests of QED
- Quantum simulations of QED
- Non-perturbative QED
