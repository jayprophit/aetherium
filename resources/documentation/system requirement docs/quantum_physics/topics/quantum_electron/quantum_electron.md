# Quantum Electron

## Overview

The electron is a fundamental subatomic particle that plays a central role in quantum mechanics, chemistry, and solid-state physics. Its quantum mechanical properties are essential for understanding atomic structure, chemical bonding, and modern electronics.

## Key Concepts

### Dirac Equation

The relativistic quantum mechanical wave equation for electrons:

$$(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m)\psi = 0$$

### Spin and Magnetic Moment

- Intrinsic spin: $\hbar/2$
- g-factor: $g_e \approx -2.002319$
- Magnetic moment: $\boldsymbol{\mu} = -g_e \frac{\mu_B}{\hbar} \mathbf{S}$

### Quantum Numbers

Electrons in atoms are described by four quantum numbers:
1. Principal quantum number ($n$)
2. Azimuthal quantum number ($l$)
3. Magnetic quantum number ($m_l$)
4. Spin quantum number ($m_s$)
