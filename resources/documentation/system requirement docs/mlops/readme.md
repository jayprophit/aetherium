# MLOps for Robotics Knowledge Base

MLOps integrates machine learning workflows with DevOps practices, enabling automated model training, validation, deployment, and monitoring.

## Key Components
- **Data Versioning:** Track datasets and model versions
- **Model Training Pipelines:** Automated with CI/CD
- **Validation:** Automated testing and evaluation
- **Deployment:** Containerized model serving
- **Monitoring:** Model drift and performance checks

## Example Pipeline (Pseudocode)
```python
def mlops_pipeline(data, model):
    data = preprocess(data)
    model = train(data)
    validate(model)
    deploy(model)
    monitor(model)
```
