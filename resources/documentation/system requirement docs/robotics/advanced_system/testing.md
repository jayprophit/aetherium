## Overview

Robust testing and validation are essential for reliable robotics. This includes unit, integration, simulation, and system-level tests, plus CI/CD automation.

## Unit Testing
- Test individual modules (control, perception, navigation)
- Use frameworks: `pytest`, `unittest`, `ros2test`

## Integration & Simulation Testing
- Test module interactions in simulation (Gazebo, Webots, Isaac Sim)
- Scenario-based testing (obstacle courses, multi-robot, etc.)

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- Automated test pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Linting, coverage, and regression checks

## Sample Code: Unit Test for Path Planning
```python
def test_astar_plan():
    grid = np.zeros((10, 10))
    start = (0, 0)
    goal = (9, 9)
    path = astar_plan(start, goal, grid)
    assert path[0] == start
    assert path[-1] == goal
```
