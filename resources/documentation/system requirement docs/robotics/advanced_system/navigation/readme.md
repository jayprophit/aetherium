        return planner.generate_path(start, goal)
    
    def execute_trajectory(self, trajectory):
        """Execute planned trajectory with real-time control"""
        for waypoint in trajectory:

            while not self.at_waypoint(waypoint):

    def generate_leg_trajectory(self, leg_id, step_time):
        """Generate trajectory for individual leg"""
        phase = (step_time + self.phase_offsets[leg_id]) % 1.0
        if phase < 0.5:  # Stance phase
            return self.stance_trajectory(phase * 2)
        else:  # Swing phase
            return self.swing_trajectory((phase - 0.5) * 2)
    
    def stance_trajectory(self, phase):
        """Generate stance phase trajectory"""
        # Ground contact movement
        return self.linear_interpolate(phase)
    
    def swing_trajectory(self, phase):
        """Generate swing phase trajectory"""
