## Overview

Human-robot interaction enables robots to communicate, collaborate, and safely operate alongside humans using speech, gesture, touch, and other modalities.

## Interaction Modalities
- Speech (ASR, TTS)
- Gesture (vision-based, wearable sensors)
- Touch (haptic feedback, tactile sensors)
- Visual cues (LEDs, screens, AR)

## Dialogue and Command Processing
- Natural language understanding (NLU)
- Command parsing and intent recognition
- Feedback and clarification loops

## Safety and Compliance
- Emergency stop
- Proximity and collision avoidance
- Privacy and data protection

## Sample Code: Voice Command Recognition
```python
import speech_recognition as sr

def recognize_voice_command():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print('Say something:')
        audio = r.listen(source)
    try:
        command = r.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f'You said: {command}')
        return command
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print('Could not understand audio')
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f'Error: {e}')
```
