## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for Electron applications)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables (see [Environment Configuration](../../temp_reorg/docs/deployment/environment.md))
3. Build and deploy using the provided scripts

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```text
# NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out
# # NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out
# # # Application
# # NODE_ENV=development
# # PORT=3000
# # 
# # # Database
# # DB_HOST=localhost
# # DB_PORT=5432
# # DB_NAME=myapp
# # DB_USER=user
# # DB_PASSWORD=password
# # 
# # # Cloud Provider
# # CLOUD_PROVIDER=aws
# # REGION=us-west-2
# # 
# # # Secrets (use secrets manager in production)
# # API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# # JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```text

## Overview
Deployment for the robotics knowledge base leverages containerization, environment management, and automated workflows for reproducibility and scalability. See the following resources for details:

- [DevOps](../devops/README.md)
- [MLOps](../mlops/README.md)
- [AIOps](../aiops/README.md)
- [Dockerfile](../../Dockerfile)
- [DevContainer](../../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
- [.env Example](../../.env)

### Local Development

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Using Node.js
npm install
npm run dev
```text

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t myapp:latest .

# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Apply Terraform configuration
cd terraform/
terraform init
terraform apply
```python

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Metrics**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logs**: ELK Stack, Loki
- **Tracing**: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry

## Security Best Practices

1. Use secrets management for sensitive data
2. Implement network policies
3. Regular security audits
4. Automated vulnerability scanning

## Troubleshooting

See [Troubleshooting Guide](../../temp_reorg/docs/robotics/troubleshooting.md) for common issues and solutions.
