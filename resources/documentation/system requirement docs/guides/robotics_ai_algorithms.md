# Robotics AI Algorithms

This guide covers core algorithms used in advanced robotics, including perception, navigation, and control.

## Key Algorithms

- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Enables robots to map and navigate unknown environments.
- **Path Planning**: Algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra, and RRT for efficient navigation.
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection, segmentation, and tracking using deep learning (YOLO, Mask R-CNN, etc.).
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors (IMU, LiDAR, cameras) for robust perception.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training robots to learn optimal actions through trial and error.

## Example: Path Planning with A*

```python
import heapq

def astar(start, goal, neighbors_fn, cost_fn, heuristic_fn):
    open_set = [(0 + heuristic_fn(start, goal), 0, start, [])]
    closed_set = set()
    while open_set:
        est_total, cost, node, path = heapq.heappop(open_set)
        if node == goal:
            return path + [node]
        if node in closed_set:
            continue
        closed_set.add(node)
        for neighbor in neighbors_fn(node):
            if neighbor not in closed_set:
                heapq.heappush(open_set, (
                    cost + cost_fn(node, neighbor) + heuristic_fn(neighbor, goal),
                    cost + cost_fn(node, neighbor),
                    neighbor,
                    path + [node]
                ))
    return None
```
