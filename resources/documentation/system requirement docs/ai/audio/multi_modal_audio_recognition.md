# Multi-Modal Audio Recognition

This guide provides a comprehensive implementation approach for recognizing and classifying various audio-based inputs using deep learning techniques. The system can identify and classify:

- Voice and speaker identity
- Speech and language
- Audio types (music, noise, speech)
- Music genres
- Environmental sounds

## Implementation Overview

The implementation uses a combination of audio processing and deep learning techniques:

1. **Audio Preprocessing**: Load, transform, and extract features from audio files
2. **Speech Recognition**: Convert spoken words into text
3. **Voice Analysis**: Identify speakers and their characteristics
4. **Audio Classification**: Categorize different types of audio (music, noise, speech)
5. **Language Recognition**: Identify the language being spoken

## Technical Approach

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras librosa opencv-python torch torchvision transformers speechrecognition pydub deepspeech
```

### 2. Speech Recognition with DeepSpeech

```text
import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import wave
import speech_recognition as sr

# Load DeepSpeech pre-trained model
model_file_path = 'deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm'  # Path to the model
scorer_file_path = 'deepspeech-0.9.3-models.scorer'  # Path to the scorer

model = deepspeech.Model(model_file_path)
model.enableExternalScorer(scorer_file_path)

# Function to recognize speech from an audio file
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    with wave.open(audio_file, 'rb') as wf:
        frames = wf.getnframes()
        buffer = wf.readframes(frames)
        audio = np.frombuffer(buffer, dtype=np.int16)
        
        # Perform speech recognition using DeepSpeech
        text = model.stt(audio)
        return text

# Test the function with a sample WAV file
text_output = speech_to_text('test_audio.wav')
print(f"Recognized Speech: {text_output}")"'"'
```text

### 3. Voice Recognition with SpeechRecognition

```pythoimport speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize recognizer
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

def recognize_voice():
    # Use the microphone to capture the audio input
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    
    try:
        # Recognize speech using Google's speech recognition engine
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"Recognized Text: {text}")
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Could not understand audio")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Recognition error: {e}")

# Call the voice recognition function
recognize_voice()"'()
``# NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out
# 
# The SpeechRecognition library allows capturing and processing speech input using popular engines like Google Speech Recognition. This code captures audio from the microphone and converts spoken language to text.
# 
# ### 4. Audio Classification with Librosa
# a

```text
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load a pre-trained sound classification model
model = load_model('sound_classification_model.h5')

# Function to extract features from audio file
def extract_audio_features(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, duration=5.0)  # Load audio file, limit to 5 seconds
    mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=40)
    mfcc_scaled = np.mean(mfcc.T, axis=0)
    return mfcc_scaled

# Function to classify audio type
def classify_audio(audio_file):
    features = extract_audio_features(audio_file)
    features = np.expand_dims(features, axis=0)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    class_label = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]
    
    if class_label == 0:
        return "Music"
    elif class_label == 1:
        return "Speech"
    elif class_label == 2:
        return "Noise"
    else:
        return "Unknown Sound"

# Test with an audio file
audio_class = classify_a# NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out
# 
# Librosa extracts Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) from audio files, which are then used as features for audio classification models to distinguish between different audio types.
# 
# ### 5. Music Recognition and Genre Classification
# ween different audio types.

### 5. Music Recognition and Genre Classification

```pimport librosa
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, LSTM

# Load a music audio file and extract features
def extract_music_features(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, duration=30)
    mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=40)
    mfcc_scaled = np.mean(mfcc.T, axis=0)
    return mfcc_scaled

# Create a simple neural network model for genre classification
def create_music_model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(256, input_shape=(40,), activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))  # Assuming 10 music genres
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Load pre-trained model (assumed to be already trained)
music_model = create_music_model()
music_model.load_weights('music_genre_model.h5')

# Classify music genre
def classify_music_genre(audio_file):
    features = extract_music_features(audio_file)
    features = np.expand_dims(features, axis=0)
    prediction = music_model.predict(features)
    genre_label = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]
    
    genre_dict = {0: "Rock", 1: "Jazz", 2: "Classical", 3: "Pop", 4: "Hip-Hop"}
    return genre_dict.get(genre_l# NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out
# 
# This implementation extracts MFCC features from music files and uses a neural network model to classify music into different genres, such as rock, jazz, classical, etc.
# 
# ### 6. Language Recognition (NLP)
# 
# ``from transformers import pipeline
# 
# # Initialize a language identification pipeline
# language_identifier = pipeline("translation", model="Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-multi")
# 
# # Function to detect language
# def detect_language(text):
#     return language_identifier(text)[0]['translation_text']
# 
# # Example text input for language recognition
# text_input = "Bonjour, comment ?a va?"
# detected_language = detect_language(text_input)
# print(f"Detected Language: {detected_language}")"'guage}")ecognition
text_input = "Bonjour, comment ?a va?"
detected_language = detect_language(text_input)
print(f"Detected import librosa
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load pre-trained environmental sound classification model
sound_model = load_model('environmental_sound_classification_model.h5')

# Function to extract features from sound
def extract_sound_features(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, duration=5)
    mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=40)
    return np.mean(mfcc.T, axis=0)

# Function to classify environmental sounds
def classify_sound(audio_file):
    features = extract_sound_features(audio_file)
    features = np.expand_dims(features, axis=0)
    
    # Predict using the sound classification model
    prediction = sound_model.predict(features)
    class_label = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]
    
    # Mapping of sound classes (assuming you have 10 environmental sound classes)
    sound_classes = {
        0: 'Car Horn',
        1: 'Dog Barking',
        2: 'Drilling',
        3: 'Engine Idling',
        4: 'Gun Shot',
        5: 'Jackhammer',
        6: 'Siren',
        7: 'Street Music',
        8: 'Air Conditioner',
        9: 'Children Playing'
    }
    
    return sound_classes.get(class_label, 'Unknown Sound')

# Test the sound recognition function
sound_class = classify_sound('test_environmental_sound.wav')
print(f"Detected Sound Class: {sound_class}")"'Conditioner',
        9: 'Children Playing'
    }
    
    return sound_classes.get(class_label, 'Unknown Sound')

# Test the sound recognition function
sound_class = classify_sound('test_environmental_sound.wav')
print(f"Detected Sound Class: {sound_class}")
```

This implementation classifies environmental sounds like sirens, car horns, and barking dogs using audio feature extraction and a specialized model.

## Integration with Multi-Modal System

This audio recognition system can be integrated with the [visual recognition system](../vision/multi_category_object_recognition.md) to create a unified multi-modal recognition platform. The combination enables:

1. **Audio-Visual Scene Understanding**: Correlating sounds with visual objects
2. **Context-Enhanced Recognition**: Using multiple modalities to improve accuracy
3. **Multi-Sensory Applications**: Applications that can process both audio and visual inputs

## Optimization Considerations

- **Real-time Processing**: Use streaming audio processing for continuous recognition
- **Model Compression**: Apply quantization for deployment on edge devices
- **Audio Enhancement**: Apply noise reduction for improved performance in noisy environments
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple audio samples together for higher throughput
