## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- FreeCAD (for CAD automation)
- OpenSCAD (for parametric modeling)
- Required Python packages:
  ```
# NOTE: The following code had issues and was commented out
#   numpy scipy sympy deap tensorflow keras paho-mqtt
#   ```
# 
# ### Installation
# 1. Install system dependencies:
#    ```bash
#    # On Ubuntu/Debian
#    sudo apt-get install freecad openscad
#    
#    # On Windows
#    # Download and install FreeCAD and OpenSCAD from their official websites
#    ```
# 
# 2. Install Python packages:
#    ```bash
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#    ```
# 
# ## Quick Start Example
# 
# ### Basic CAD Generation
```python
import FreeCAD, Part

def create_parametric_cylinder(radius, height, output_file):
    doc = FreeCAD.newDocument("ParametricDesign")
    cylinder = Part.makeCylinder(radiu# NOTE: The following code had issues and was commented out
# 
# ### Material Simulation(cylinder)
    doc.recompute()
    doc.saveAs(output_file)
    return doc
```

### Material Simulation
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_mass(volume, material_density):
    """Calculate mass from volume and material density."""
    return volume * material_density

def calculate_stress(force, area):
    """Calculate stress (Ïƒ = F/A)."""
    return force / area if area > 0 else 0:
```
