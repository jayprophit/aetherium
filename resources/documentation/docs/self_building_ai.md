# Self-Building AI System

## Overview
The Self-Building AI project enables an AI system to iteratively improve, fix, and extend itself using modern cloud, DevOps/MLOps, and AI technologies. It supports both private (unrestricted) and public (subscription-based) builds, and is designed to be accessible even to beginners using only an iPad Pro and online tools (e.g., GitHub Codespaces).

## Key Features
- **Error Detection & Self-Iteration:** Automatically detects code errors, generates fixes with ChatGPT/OpenAI, and applies changes.
- **Iterative Development:** Cycles through error detection, fixing, feature addition, and code cleanup.
- **User Interface:** Streamlit-based web app with prompt input, error display, and visual code/design preview.
- **Environment Setup:** Uses GitHub, Codespaces, Docker, .env, .gitignore, and LICENSE for best practices.
- **Deployment:** Free hosting with Render/Replit, Docker containerization, and upgrade path to paid cloud services.
- **Integration:** APIs, cloud services, and external devices (CAD, IoT, 3D printing) supported.

## How to Use
1. **Set up repo in GitHub, add .gitignore, LICENSE, .env, requirements.txt.**
2. **Open in Codespaces, install dependencies.**
3. **Run Streamlit app for UI, or self-iteration script for auto-fixing.**
4. **Deploy via Docker or free services like Render.**

---

## Next Steps
- Expand code for public subscription features, advanced DevOps/MLOps, and integration with CAD, IoT, and 3D printing workflows.
- Add more advanced UI/UX and code generation/preview tools.
- Continue iterative self-improvement cycles.
