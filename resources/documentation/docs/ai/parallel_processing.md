## 1. Introduction to Parallel Processing

Parallel processing enables AI systems to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness. This document covers various techniques for implementing parallel processing in Python-based AI systems.

## 2. Asynchronous Programming (Asyncio)

Asyncio is ideal for I/O-bound operations where tasks spend time waiting for external resources.

```python
import asyncio

async def process_data(source):
    print(f"Processing data from {source}...")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate I/O operation
    return f"Processed {source}"

async def main():
    tasks = [
        process_data("API"),
        process_data("Database"),
        process_data("File System")
    ]
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
``````python
import threading as import time

class DataProcessor(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, data_source):
        super().__init__();
        self.data_source = data_source;
        self.result = None;
        
    def run(self):
        print(f"Processing {self.data_source} in thread {threading.get_ident()}")
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulate work
        self.result = f"Processed {self.data_source}";

# Create and start threads
threads = [DataProcessor(f"Source-{i}") for i in range(3)]:;
for t in threads:
    t.start();

# Wait for all threads to complete:
for t in threads:
    t.join();
    print(t.result)
``````python
from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
import time

def process_task(task_id, result_queue):
    print(f"Process {task_id}: Starting")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate CPU work
    result_queue.put(f"Result from process {task_id}")

def main():
    result_queue = Queue()
    processes = []
    
    # Create processes
    for i in range(3):
        p = Process(target=process_task, args=(i, result_queue))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()
    
    # Wait for all processes to complete:
    for p in processes:
        p.join()
    
    # Collect results
    while not result_queue.empty():
        print(result_queue.get())
