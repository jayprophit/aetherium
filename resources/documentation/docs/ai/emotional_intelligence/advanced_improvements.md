        super().__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=100, hidden_size=128, num_layers=2, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(128, 10)  # 10 emotions
    def forward(self, x):

## 10A. Practical Integration & Usage Tips (Enhanced)

- For hands-on code, see [src/ai/emotional_intelligence.py](../../../src/ai/emotional_intelligence.py) for unified emotional AI, memory, conflict resolution, and reinforcement learning.
- For advanced architectures (GANs/meta-learning/Bayesian/quantum/multi-agent/cognitive), see [advanced_emotional_ai.md](../../advanced_emotional_ai.md) for theory, and reference the code templates below for integration.

### GANs for Simulated Emotions
- Use GANs to generate synthetic emotional data for training or augmentation.
- Example: Integrate a GAN-based generator as a data source for the emotional system.
- See [Section 5.2 in advanced_emotional_ai.md](../../../temp_reorg/docs/ai/advanced_emotional_ai.md) for design.

### Meta-Learning for Adaptability
- Implement meta-learning loops to adapt emotion models to new users or domains.
- Example: Use a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) wrapper around the emotional network.
- See [Section 5.3 in advanced_emotional_ai.md](../../../temp_reorg/docs/ai/advanced_emotional_ai.md).

### Bayesian Networks for Uncertainty
- Integrate Bayesian inference to model uncertainty in emotion predictions.
- Example: Use [pgmpy](https://pgmpy.org/) to add a Bayesian layer to your emotion pipeline.
- See [Section 5.1 in advanced_emotional_ai.md](../../../temp_reorg/docs/ai/advanced_emotional_ai.md).

### Quantum/IoT Emotional Processing
- Explore quantum-inspired modules for richer emotional state representations.
- Example: Add a quantum processing stub as a plugin to the emotional system.
- See [Section 7 in advanced_emotional_ai.md](../../../temp_reorg/docs/ai/advanced_emotional_ai.md).

### Multi-Agent and Cognitive Architectures
- Use multi-agent and global workspace designs for distributed or collective emotion modeling.
- Example: Compose several EmotionalSystem instances and synchronize via a GlobalWorkspace controller.
- See [Section 2 and 3 in advanced_emotional_ai.md](../../../temp_reorg/docs/ai/advanced_emotional_ai.md).

### Ethical Safeguards
- Implement consent, privacy, and anti-bias checks in all emotional AI modules.
- See [Section 6 in advanced_emotional_ai.md](../../../temp_reorg/docs/ai/advanced_emotional_ai.md).

### Patent/Research Concepts
- For research or patenting, document novel architectures and cite [References in advanced_emotional_ai.md](../../../temp_reorg/docs/ai/advanced_emotional_ai.md).
