# Emotional Intelligence and Self-Awareness System

[![Tests](https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge-base/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge-base/actions)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/emotional-ai/badge/?version=latest)](https://emotional-ai.readthedocs.io/)

A comprehensive implementation of emotional intelligence and self-awareness capabilities for AI systems, featuring emotion modeling, introspection, empathy, and emotional memory.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Full Emotional Spectrum**: Models 24+ human emotions with varying intensities using Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) model
- **Neural Network-Based**: Deep learning models for emotion processing and regulation
- **Self-Reflection**: Metacognitive monitoring and introspection capabilities
- **Social Intelligence**: Empathy, perspective-taking, and social awareness
- **Emotional Memory**: Long-term storage and retrieval of emotional experiences
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Emotionally-intelligent responses and decision-making
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible architecture for custom implementations

```python
from examples.emotional_intelligence.demo_emotional_ai import EmotionModel, SelfAwarenessModule

# Initialize components
emotion_model = EmotionModel()
self_awareness = SelfAwarenessModule(emotion_model)

# Process emotional stimulus
emotion_model.update_emotion({"valence": 0.8, "arousal": 0.9, "dominance": 0.7})
print(f"Current emotion: {emotion_model.get_emotion_label()}")

# Get self-reflection
reflection = await self_awareness.reflect()
print(f"Self-reflection: {reflection}")
```

## ðŸ§© Core Components

### 1. Emotion Models (`/emotion_models/`)
- `core_emotion_model.py`: Neural network-based model for simulating human emotional spectrum
  - Dimensional model (Valence, Arousal, Dominance)
  - Basic and social emotions
  - Emotion blending and regulation
  - [View Example Usage](../../../temp_reorg/src/ai/demo_emotional_ai.py)

### 2. Self-Awareness (`/self_awareness/`)
- `introspection.py`: Implements self-reflection and metacognitive capabilities
  - Thought monitoring and analysis
  - Behavioral pattern recognition
  - Self-evaluation and critique
  - Goal alignment assessment
  - [Example Implementation](../../../temp_reorg/src/ai/demo_emotional_ai.py)

### 3. Empathy and Social Awareness (`/empathy/`)

  - Emotion recognition in others
  - Perspective taking
  - Empathic responding
  - Social norm understanding
  - [Example Implementation](../../../temp_reorg/src/ai/demo_emotional_ai.py)

### 4. Emotional Memory (`/memory/`)
- `emotional_memory.py`: Manages storage and retrieval of emotional experiences
  - Episodic memory for specific events
  - Semantic memory for generalized knowledge
  - Memory consolidation and forgetting
  - Emotional pattern recognition

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9.0+
- See `requirements.txt` for full dependencies

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotional-intelligence-ai.git
cd emotional-intelligence-ai

# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from emotion_models.core_emotion_model import CoreEmotionModel
from self_awareness.introspection import IntrospectionEngine
from empathy.social_awareness import EmpathyEngine
from memory.emotional_memory import EmotionalMemory

# Initialize components
emotion_model = CoreEmotionModel()
introspection = IntrospectionEngine(emotion_model)
empathy = EmpathyEngine()
memory = EmotionalMemory()

# Process an emotional event
current_emotion = torch.tensor([0.8, 0.6, 0.4])  # Example emotion vector
context = {
    'event': 'received_compliment',
    'source': 'colleague',
    'intensity': 0.8
}

# Get emotional response
response = emotion_model(current_emotion.unsqueeze(0))

# Engage in self-reflection
reflection = introspection.reflect({
    'emotion': response,
    'context': context,
    'goals': ['be_professional', 'build_relationships']
}, depth=2)

# Store in memory
memory_id = memory.add_episodic_memory(
    emotion=response,
    context=context,
    importance=0.7
)
```
