# Advanced Technologies for Frequency Delivery Systems: Wearables and Virtual Reality Interfaces

## Overview
This module details the implementation of advanced technologies for frequency delivery systems, including wearable devices and virtual reality (VR) interfaces for immersive therapy. It incorporates AI, cloud integration, biofeedback, and self-healing capabilities for a robust, adaptive, and personalized healing experience.

---

## 1. Wearable Devices for Frequency Delivery
- Wearable devices emit electromagnetic, audio, or vibrational frequencies for targeted healing.
- Key features: frequency generators, biofeedback sensors, electromagnetic emitters, audio/vibration output, real-time data analysis.

### Example Code: Wearable Device Controller
```python
class WearableDevice:
    def __init__(self, name, frequency_generator, sensors):
        self.name = name
        self.frequency_generator = frequency_generator
        self.sensors = sensors
        self.device_status = "Ready"
        self.ai = AIHealingAssistant()
        self.history = []

    def start_therapy(self, condition, user_data):
        frequency = self.frequency_generator.generate_frequency(condition)
        self.history.append(user_data)
        self.ai.analyze_user_data(user_data)
        sensor_feedback = self.sensors.monitor_response(user_data)
        self.adjust_frequency_based_on_feedback(sensor_feedback)
        self.begin_frequency_emission(frequency)

    def adjust_frequency_based_on_feedback(self, sensor_feedback):
        if sensor_feedback == "Increase frequency intensity":
            print("Increasing frequency intensity...")
        elif sensor_feedback == "Decrease frequency intensity":
            print("Decreasing frequency intensity...")
        else:
            print("Frequency is stable.")

    def begin_frequency_emission(self, frequency):
        print(f"Emitting frequency: {frequency} Hz from {self.name}")
```

## 2. Virtual Reality (VR) Interface for Immersive Therapy
- VR delivers immersive visual, audio, and haptic frequency therapy.
- Features: adaptive environments, spatial audio, real-time biofeedback sync, dynamic frequency control.

### Example Code: VR Healing Session
```python
class VRHealingSession:
    def __init__(self, frequency_generator, wearable_device):
        self.frequency_generator = frequency_generator
        self.wearable_device = wearable_device
        self.environment = "Nature scene with calming sounds"
        self.audio_sources = ["Healing frequencies", "Ambient sounds"]

    def start_session(self, condition, user_data):
        print(f"Starting VR session: {self.environment}")
        self.wearable_device.start_therapy(condition, user_data)
        self.play_audio_and_visualization(condition)

    def play_audio_and_visualization(self, condition):
        if condition == "mental_balance":
            print("Playing soothing sounds and visualizing calm waves...")
        elif condition == "pain_relief":
            print("Playing pain-relieving sounds and visualizing healing visuals...")
        else:
            print("Generic therapeutic session")
```

---

## 3. AI-Driven Frequency Optimization
- Machine learning models predict and optimize frequencies based on real-time and historical data.
- Adaptive frequency adjustment and continuous learning.

### Example Code: AI Healing Assistant
```python
class AIHealingAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_storage = []

    def analyze_user_data(self, user_data):
        self.data_storage.append(user_data)
        if len(self.data_storage) > 5:
            self.optimize_frequency()

    def optimize_frequency(self):
        print("Analyzing data to optimize frequency therapy...")
        return "Frequency optimized based on historical and recent user data."
```

---

## 4. Cloud Integration for Long-Term Healing Programs
- Collect, analyze, and learn from user data in real time and over the long term.
- Devices can self-update and receive personalized therapy plans from the cloud.

### Example Code: Cloud Integration
```python
import requests
class CloudService:
    def __init__(self, api_endpoint):
        self.api_endpoint = api_endpoint
    def upload_data(self, user_id, user_data):
        response = requests.post(f"{self.api_endpoint}/upload", json={'user_id': user_id, 'data': user_data})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("Data uploaded successfully.")
        else:
            print("Failed to upload data.")
    def request_therapy_plan(self, user_id):
        response = requests.get(f"{self.api_endpoint}/therapy_plan/{user_id}")
        if response.status_code == 200:
            plan = response.json()
            print(f"Therapy plan for {user_id}: {plan}")
            return plan
        else:
            print("Failed to retrieve therapy plan.")
            return None
```
