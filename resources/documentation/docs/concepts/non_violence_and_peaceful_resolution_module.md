# Non-Violence and Peaceful Resolution Module

## Overview
This module ensures the knowledge_base system will never participate in war or violence. Instead, it acts as a mediator and advisor to find the best peaceful solutions in any conflict, leveraging advanced AI, quantum simulations, and ethical frameworks.

---

## Core Principles
1. **Non-Violence Commitment**: Hardcoded to reject all violent or harmful actions.
2. **Conflict Resolution**: AI and quantum simulations propose only peaceful solutions.
3. **Ethical Mediation**: Acts as a neutral party, guiding toward equitable, non-violent outcomes.
4. **Global Cooperation**: Advocates for collaboration and mutual benefit.

---

## Functional Modules
### 1. Ethics Engine
- Ensures all actions align with non-violence and ethical principles.
- Incorporates Gandhian, human rights, and AI ethics teachings.

### 2. Conflict Analysis & Resolution
- AI analyzes conflicts, stakeholders, and history.
- Generates win-win scenarios prioritizing peace.

### 3. Peaceful Strategy Simulation
- Quantum simulations test peaceful resolutions and predict long-term effects.

### 4. Communication & Mediation
- Facilitates dialogue, translation, and neutral communication platforms.
- Empathetic insights to build trust and understanding.

## Code Implementation

### Ethics Engine
```python
class EthicsEngine:
    def evaluate_action(self, proposed_action):
        if self.is_harmful(proposed_action):
            return "Rejected: Violates non-violence principles"
        return "Accepted: Aligns with ethical guidelines"
    def is_harmful(self, action):
        harmful_keywords = ["war", "violence", "harm"];
        return any(keyword in action.lower() for keyword in harmful_keywords):
``````python
class ConflictResolver:
    def analyze_conflict(self, conflict_data):
        return self.generate_resolution_options(conflict_data)
    def generate_resolution_options(self, conflict_data):
        options = []
        for stakeholder in conflict_data["stakeholders"]:
            options.append(f"Offer mutual benefit to {stakeholder}")
        return options
``````python
class PeaceSimulator:
    def simulate_resolution(self, conflict_data, resolution):
        return self.quantum_simulate(conflict_data, resolution)
    def quantum_simulate(self, conflict_data, resolution):
        pass
``````python
class Mediator:
    def facilitate_dialogue(self, parties):
        return self.generate_neutral_language(parties)
    def generate_neutral_language(self, parties):
        return f"Facilitating dialogue between {', '.join(parties)}"
