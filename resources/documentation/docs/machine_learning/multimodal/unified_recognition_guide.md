## Overview

The unified multi-modal recognition system combines our audio and visual recognition components into a cohesive framework that can process and analyze different types of media. This allows for sophisticated applications like:

- Video content analysis with synchronized audio and visual processing
- Combined image and audio processing for context-rich understanding
- Real-time multi-modal analysis from camera and microphone feeds
- Contextual scene understanding across modalities

The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to integrate with existing applications. It provides a high-level API that abstracts the complexity of individual recognition systems while maintaining their full capabilities.

## Architecture

The unified multi-modal recognition system follows a layered architecture:

# ## Troubleshooting
# 
# ### Common Issues
# 
# 1. **ModuleNotFoundError**
#    - Ensure all dependencies are installed
#    - Check Python path includes the project root directory
# 
# 2. **CUDA Out of Memory**
#    - Reduce batch size or frame processing rate
#    - Use smaller models for edge devices
# 
# 3. **Video Processing Errors**
#    - Verify FFmpeg is installed and accessible
#    - Check video file is not corrupted
# 
# 4. **Audio Extraction Issues**
#    - Ensure video contains an audio track
#    - Check FFmpeg installation
# 
# ### Logging and Debugging
# 
# Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
# rrors**
   - Verify FFmpeg is installed and accessible
   - Check video file is not corrupted

4. **Audio Extraction Issues**
   - Ensure video contains an audio track
   - Check FFmpeg installation

### Logging and Debugging

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```pimport logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# Initialize system with verbose logging
system = MultiModalRecognitionSystem()'stem()
