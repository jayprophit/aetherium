# Preprocessing

## Overview
Data preprocessing transforms raw data into a clean, structured format suitable for machine learning algorithms. This critical step ensures that the data is consistent, complete, and optimized for model training.

## Key Tasks

### Cleaning Data
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation (mean, median, mode), removal, or prediction.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and eliminating redundant data points.
- **Fixing Inconsistencies**: Standardizing formats, units, and representations.
- **Handling Outliers**: Identifying and treating extreme values through capping, removal, or transformation.

### Scaling Features
- **Normalization**: Scaling features to a range (typically [0,1]) using Min-Max scaling.
- **Standardization**: Transforming features to have zero mean and unit variance (z-scores).
- **Robust Scaling**: Scaling based on percentiles, less affected by outliers.
- **Log Transformation**: Handling skewed distributions and reducing the impact of extreme values.

### Handling Categorical Data
- **Label Encoding**: Converting categorical values to numeric labels (0, 1, 2...).
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Creating binary columns for each category.
- **Target Encoding**: Replacing categories with their mean target value.
- **Embeddings**: Learning dense vector representations for categories.

### Text Processing
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words, phrases, or symbols.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root form.
- **Stop Word Removal**: Filtering out common words with little meaning.
- **TF-IDF Transformation**: Weighting terms by their frequency and importance.
- **Word Embeddings**: Converting words to vector representations (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.).

## Best Practices
1. **Create Pipelines**: Automate and standardize preprocessing steps for reproducibility.
2. **Document Transformations**: Keep track of all transformations applied to the data.
3. **Check for Data Leakage**: Ensure information from test data doesn't influence preprocessing.
4. **Validate Results**: Verify that preprocessed data maintains the essential characteristics of the original dataset.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Consider creating new features that might improve model performance.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Scikit-learn**: `sklearn.preprocessing` for most standard preprocessing tasks.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NLTK/spaCy**: For text preprocessing tasks.
- **Feature-engine**: Advanced feature engineering and preprocessing.
- **Optimus**: Automates preprocessing tasks for big data.

## Implementation Example
```python
# Example: Preprocessing pipeline with scikit-learn
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer as from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline as from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer as from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
import pandas as as pd
import numpy as as np

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'age': [25, 30, np.nan, 40, 35],
    'income': [50000, 70000, 60000, np.nan, 80000],
    'education': ['Bachelors', 'Masters', 'PhD', 'Bachelors', 'Masters']
})

# Define numeric and categorical features
numeric_features = ['age', 'income']
categorical_features = ['education']

# Define preprocessing steps for numeric features
numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

# Define preprocessing steps for categorical features
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
])

# Combine preprocessing steps
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
    ])

# Create and apply the preprocessing pipeline
preprocessing_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor)])
processed_data = preprocessing_pipeline.fit_transform(data)
:
print("Original data shape:", data.shape)
print("Processed data shape:", processed_data.shape)
```
