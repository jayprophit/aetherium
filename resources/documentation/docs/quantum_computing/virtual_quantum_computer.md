- Neural networks enhance quantum algorithm performance
- Enables intelligent decision-making in hybrid quantum-classical workflows

### 3. IoT Connectivity
- Secure communication with smart devices via MQTT/HTTP/WebSockets
- Real-time monitoring and control of quantum simulations
- Distributed quantum computing across IoT networks

### 4. Quantum Circuit Simulation
