# Theory Example: Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

**Originator:** Giulio Tononi
**First Published:** 2004
**Field:** Neuroscience, Consciousness Studies

## Summary
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) proposes that consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. It quantifies consciousness as "phi" (Φ), representing the amount of integrated information generated by a system.

## Key Concepts
- Information integration
- Phi (Φ) as a measure of consciousness
- System irreducibility
