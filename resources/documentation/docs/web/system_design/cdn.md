# Content Delivery Networks (CDN) in System Design

## Overview

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that delivers web content and assets to users based on their geographic location. CDNs improve performance, reduce latency, and increase reliability for static and dynamic content delivery.

## Key Characteristics
- Geographically distributed edge servers
- Caches static assets (images, scripts, videos)
- Reduces origin server load
- Improves user experience by lowering latency
- Provides DDoS protection and security features

## Use Cases
- Accelerating website load times globally
- Video streaming
- Large-scale software distribution
- API acceleration
- DDoS mitigation

## Implementation Example: Using Cloudflare CDN
1. Sign up for a CDN provider (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront)
2. Update DNS records to point to the CDN
3. Configure caching, SSL, and security settings in the CDN dashboard

## Best Practices
- Cache static assets with long TTLs
- Use cache busting for updated files
- Enable HTTPS for all CDN traffic
- Monitor CDN analytics for performance and security
- Set up fallback to origin on cache miss
