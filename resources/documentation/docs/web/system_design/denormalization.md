# Denormalization in System Design

## Overview

Denormalization is the process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a database by merging tables or duplicating data to improve read performance.

## Pros
- Faster read queries
- Simpler queries for reporting

## Cons
- Data inconsistency risk
- More complex writes/updates
- Increased storage requirements

## Example: Denormalized Table
- Combine `orders` and `order_items` into a single table for analytics

## Best Practices
- Use denormalization for read-heavy workloads
- Automate data synchronization
- Monitor for data anomalies
