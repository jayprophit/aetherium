# ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Software

## Definition
ERP software automates and connects business processes (e.g., accounting, procurement, inventory) using a single database, ensuring real-time data accuracy and eliminating silos.

## Key Modules
| Module                 | Functions                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Finance & Accounting   | General ledger, invoicing, financial reporting |
| Supply Chain Management| Inventory, procurement, logistics         |
| Human Resources        | Payroll, recruitment, performance management |
| Manufacturing          | Production scheduling, quality control    |
| CRM                    | Sales tracking, customer service          |

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge                | Solution                                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Complexity               | Start with one module (e.g., finance) before scaling  |
| High Training Costs      | Leverage free vendor resources (e.g., SAP Learning Hub)|
| User Resistance          | Implement phased rollouts and early training          |
| Customization Difficulties| Prioritize configuration over code changes           |

## Best Practices
- Start with core modules and expand gradually
- Use vendor-provided training and documentation
- Involve end-users early to reduce resistance
- Prefer configuration over custom code
- Ensure data migration and integration are planned
