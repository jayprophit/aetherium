# Vertical Partitioning in System Design

## Overview

Vertical partitioning splits a database table into smaller tables, each containing a subset of columns. It optimizes performance, security, and manageability for large and complex databases.

## Benefits
- Improved query performance
- Reduced I/O for common queries
- Enhanced security (sensitive columns separated)

## Example: Vertical Partitioning
- Table `users` split into `user_profile` (id, name, email) and `user_security` (id, password_hash, last_login)

## Best Practices
- Partition only when necessary
- Monitor query performance
- Keep primary keys consistent across partitions
