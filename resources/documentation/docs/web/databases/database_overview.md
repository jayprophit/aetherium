# Database Systems Overview

## Introduction

Database systems are foundational components in modern system architecture, responsible for reliable data storage, retrieval, and management. Choosing the right database solution is critical for application performance, scalability, and reliability.

## SQL vs NoSQL Databases

### SQL Databases
SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational database management systems that store data in structured tables with predefined schemas.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Structured data with strict schemas
- ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Primary and foreign key relationships
- Complex query capabilities
- Data normalization

**Popular Systems:**
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL/MariaDB
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQLite

**Sample Schema Definition (PostgreSQL):**
```text
# NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out
# # NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out
# # CREATE TABLE users (
# #     user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
# #     username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
# #     email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
# #     password_hash VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
# #     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
# # );
``````text

sh.shardCollection("mydb.users", { "user_id": 1 }# NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out

#   username VARCHAR(50),
#   email VARCHAR(100)
# );
# CREATE TABLE user_extended (
#   user_id I# NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out

#   username VARCHAR(50),

# # CREATE TABLE order_reports (

# #   user_id INT,
# #   username VARCHAR(50),
# #   order_date TIMESTAMP,
# #   total DECIMAL(10,2),
# #   PRIMARY KEY (order_id, user_id)
# # );base load and improve response times. See [../system_design/cache.md](../system_design/cache.md).
# 
# ## Denormalization
# Adding redundant data to improve read performance at the cost of write complexity.
# 
# **Example:**system_design/cache.md](../system_design/cache.md).

# ## CAP Theorem
# A distributed database can only guarantee two of the following:
# - Consistency
# - Availability
# - Partition Tolerance
# 
# **Examples:**
# - CA: Traditional RDBMS
# - CP: MongoDB (majority writes)
# - AP: Cassandra
# 
# ## Implementation Examples
