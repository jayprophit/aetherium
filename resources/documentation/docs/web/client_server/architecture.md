# Client-Server Architecture

## Overview

Client-server architecture is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks between service providers (servers) and service requesters (clients). It is the foundation of most modern networked applications.

## Key Concepts
- **Client:** Requests resources or services from the server (e.g., web browser, mobile app)
- **Server:** Provides resources or services to clients (e.g., web server, database server)
- **Communication:** Typically over TCP/IP using protocols like HTTP/HTTPS

## Types of Client-Server Models
- **1-Tier:** All components on a single system
- **2-Tier:** Client communicates directly with the server
- **3-Tier:** Client, application server, and database server
- **N-Tier:** Multiple layers for scalability and separation of concerns

## Example: 3-Tier Web Application
```python
# NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out
# # NOTE: The following code had syntax errors and was commented out
# # [Client] <-> [Web Server] <-> [Database Server]
```

## Implementation Example: Flask Web Server
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, client!'
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Best Practices
- Separate concerns between client and server
- Use stateless protocols where possible
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Use load balancers for scalability
