# Quantum Circuit Optimization

Quantum circuit optimization is crucial for efficient quantum computation, reducing resource requirements, and improving fidelity.

## Key Concepts

- **Gate Minimization**: Reduce the number of quantum gates to minimize error.
- **Depth Reduction**: Shorten circuit depth to reduce decoherence.
- **Qubit Reuse**: Optimize qubit allocation and reuse to maximize hardware efficiency.
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization**: Use classical optimizers with quantum circuits for variational algorithms.

## Example: Qiskit Optimization

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile

qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.cx(1, 2)

# Optimize circuit
optimized_qc = transpile(qc, optimization_level=3)
print(optimized_qc)
```

## Best Practices

- Use the highest optimization level supported by your framework.
- Benchmark different transpilation strategies.
- Keep circuits as shallow as possible for NISQ devices.
