# Robotics Movement

This guide covers the principles and algorithms for robotic movement, including locomotion, kinematics, and motion planning.

## Key Concepts

- **Locomotion**: Wheeled, legged, and hybrid movement mechanisms.
- **Kinematics**: Forward and inverse kinematics for calculating joint positions.
- **Trajectory Planning**: Generating smooth and efficient movement paths.
- **Control Systems**: PID, adaptive, and model predictive control for precise motion.

## Example: Inverse Kinematics

```python
def inverse_kinematics(x, y, l1, l2):
    import math
    cos_theta2 = (x**2 + y**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    k1 = l1 + l2 * cos_theta2
    k2 = l2 * sin_theta2
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x) - math.atan2(k2, k1)
    return theta1, theta2
```
