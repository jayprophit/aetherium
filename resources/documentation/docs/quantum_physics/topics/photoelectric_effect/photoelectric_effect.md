# Photoelectric Effect

## Overview

The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation (such as light) hits a material. This phenomenon was crucial in the development of quantum mechanics, as it could not be explained by classical wave theory alone.

## Key Concepts

### Einstein's Explanation (1905)

- Light consists of discrete packets of energy called photons
- Energy of each photon: $E = h\nu$
- Work function ($\phi$): minimum energy needed to eject an electron
- Maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons: $K_{max} = h\nu - \phi$

### Mathematical Formulation

$$K_{max} = h\nu - \phi$$

Where:
- $K_{max}$ is the maximum kinetic energy of emitted electrons
- $h$ is Planck's constant
- $\nu$ is the frequency of incident light
- $\phi$ is the work function of the material

### Threshold Frequency

The minimum frequency of light needed to eject electrons:

$$\nu_0 = \frac{\phi}{h}$$

## Applications

- Photocells and solar panels
- Photomultiplier tubes
- Digital cameras (CCD and CMOS sensors)
- Spectroscopy
- Night vision devices

## Experimental Verification

- Millikan's experiments (1914-1916)
- Verification of Einstein's equation
- Determination of Planck's constant
- Time-resolved photoelectric effect studies

## Relation to Other Quantum Phenomena

- Wave-particle duality
- Photon energy quantization
- Quantum efficiency
- Photoemission spectroscopy
