# Quantum Theory

## Overview

Quantum theory is the theoretical basis of modern physics that explains the nature and behavior of matter and energy on the atomic and subatomic levels. It represents a fundamental departure from classical physics, introducing concepts like wave-particle duality, quantization, and uncertainty.

## Key Principles

### Wave-Particle Duality

All particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.

### Quantization

Physical properties take on only discrete values:

$$E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega$$

### Uncertainty Principle

Fundamental limits on precision of simultaneous measurements:

$$\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

### Superposition

Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously:

$$|\psi\rangle = \sum_n c_n |\phi_n\rangle$$

## Mathematical Formulation

### Hilbert Space

Quantum states are vectors in a complex Hilbert space.

### Operators

Physical quantities are represented by Hermitian operators.

### Time Evolution

Governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}|\psi(t)\rangle$$
