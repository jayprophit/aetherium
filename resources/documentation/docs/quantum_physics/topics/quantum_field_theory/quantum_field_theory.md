# Quantum Field Theory

## Overview

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework that combines classical field theory, special relativity, and quantum mechanics. It provides a foundation for modern particle physics and describes fundamental forces and elementary particles as excitations of underlying quantum fields.

## Key Concepts

### Fields and Particles

- Quantum fields are the fundamental entities
- Particles are quantized excitations of these fields
- Each fundamental particle type corresponds to a quantum field

### Path Integral Formulation

$$Z = \int \mathcal{D}\phi \, e^{iS[\phi]/\hbar}$$

Where:
- $Z$ is the partition function
- $\mathcal{D}\phi$ represents integration over all field configurations
- $S[\phi]$ is the action

### Feynman Diagrams

Graphical representation of particle interactions:
- Lines represent particle propagators
- Vertices represent interactions
- Loops represent quantum corrections

## Applications

- Standard Model of particle physics
- Quantum electrodynamics (QED)
- Quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
- Condensed matter physics
- Early universe cosmology

## Relation to Other Quantum Phenomena

- Quantum electrodynamics (QED)
- Quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
- Electroweak theory
- Quantum gravity

## Current Research and Open Questions

- Quantum gravity and string theory
- Beyond Standard Model physics
- Strongly coupled field theories
- Holographic principle and AdS/CFT correspondence
