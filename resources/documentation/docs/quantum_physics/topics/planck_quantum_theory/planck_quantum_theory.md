# Planck's Quantum Theory

## Overview

Max Planck's quantum theory, introduced in 1900, marked the birth of quantum mechanics. It proposed that energy is quantized rather than continuous, resolving the ultraviolet catastrophe in blackbody radiation and laying the foundation for modern quantum physics.

## Key Concepts

### Planck's Radiation Law

The spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium:

$$B_\nu(\nu, T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_BT} - 1}$$

### Energy Quantization

- Energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete packets called quanta
- Energy of each quantum: $E = h\nu$
- $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.62607015 \times 10^{-34}$ Jâ‹…s)

### Planck Units

Natural units defined using fundamental physical constants:

- Planck length: $\ell_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx 1.616255 \times 10^{-35}$ m
- Planck time: $t_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.391247 \times 10^{-44}$ s
- Planck mass: $m_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} \approx 2.176434 \times 10^{-8}$ kg

## Applications
