## Advanced Learning Techniques

### Transfer Learning

- Utilize pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, GPT) and fine-tune for specific domains
- Reduces training time and improves performance

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Fine-tuning code here...
```

### Federated Learning

- Train models across decentralized devices while keeping data localized
- Enhances privacy and security

```python
import tensorflow_federated as tff

# Define federated learning process
@tff.federated_computation
def next_fn(server_state, federated_dataset):
    # Federated training logic
    return server_state, training_metrics
```
