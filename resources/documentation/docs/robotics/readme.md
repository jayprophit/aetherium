## System Overview

Our robotic systems are built on a modular architecture that enables flexibility, scalability, and robustness across various applications:

### Core Components
- **Perception**: Computer vision, LIDAR, sensor fusion
- **Cognition**: Decision making, planning, learning
- **Action**: Locomotion, manipulation, interaction
- **Integration**: System orchestration, communication

### Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Mix and match components as needed
- **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for responsive control
- **AI/ML Integration**: Advanced learning capabilities
- **Safety First**: Built-in safety mechanisms
- **Open Standards**: ROS 2, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- ROS 2 Humble or later
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- NVIDIA GPU (for accelerated AI/ML workloads)

### Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/robotics-suite.git
   cd robotics-suite
   
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Build the System**
   ```bash
   # Build with colcon
   colcon build --symlink-install
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

3. **Run a Simple Example**
   ```bash
   # Launch the basic navigation demo
   ros2 launch demo_navigation navigation_demo.launch.py
   ```

## System Architecture

Our architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **Hardware Layer**: Sensors, actuators, and physical components
2. **Driver Layer**: Hardware abstraction and low-level control
3. **Perception Layer**: Sensor processing and environment understanding
4. **Cognition Layer**: Decision making and planning
5. **Control Layer**: Motion and task execution
6. **Application Layer**: User interfaces and high-level behaviors

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
   - Implement and test your changes
   - Run unit tests: `colcon test --packages-select your_package`
   - Submit a pull request

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for system behavior
   - Simulation testing with Gazebo
   - Real-world validation

3. **Deployment**
   - Containerized deployment with Docker
   - Over-the-air updates
   - System monitoring and diagnostics
