# Consciousness Algorithms for Robotics

## Overview
Layered awareness models for robotic self-awareness: task, environment, and existential levels.

## Features
- Task awareness: Self-monitoring of ongoing processes
- Environmental awareness: Perception and adaptation to surroundings
- Existential awareness: Meta-cognition and purpose evaluation

## Example Implementation
```python
class ConsciousnessLayer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.state = {}
    def perceive(self, input_data):
        self.state['perception'] = input_data
    def reflect(self):
        return f"{self.name} layer reflecting on state: {self.state}"

task_layer = ConsciousnessLayer('Task')
env_layer = ConsciousnessLayer('Environment')
exist_layer = ConsciousnessLayer('Existential')

# Example usage:
task_layer.perceive('Processing task')
print(task_layer.reflect())
```
