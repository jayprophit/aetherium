## Overview

Ethics and compliance are critical for safe, responsible, and lawful deployment of robotics in society. This includes data privacy, safety, transparency, and adherence to regulations.

## Ethical Principles
- **Transparency**: Make AI decisions explainable
- **Accountability**: Assign responsibility for robot actions
- **Privacy**: Protect user and bystander data
- **Fairness**: Avoid bias in algorithms and interactions
- **Safety**: Prioritize human safety in all operations
- **Autonomy**: Respect user autonomy and consent

## Compliance Requirements
- **Data protection laws**: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA (for medical robots)
- **Safety standards**: ISO 13482 (personal care robots), ISO 10218 (industrial robots)
- **AI ethics guidelines**: IEEE, EU, and national frameworks

## Implementation Strategies
- Form an ethics board or advisory group
- Conduct regular audits of AI/robotic systems
- Implement privacy-by-design in hardware/software
- Use secure data storage and encrypted communications
- Maintain logs for traceability and accountability

## Best Practices
- Engage stakeholders (users, regulators, ethicists) in design
- Provide clear user documentation on privacy and safety
- Regularly review and update compliance policies
- Train staff on ethical and legal responsibilities
