# Self-Replication and Scalability in Robotics

## Overview
Describes molecular assembly, quantum duplication, and distributed replication for scalable, redundant systems.

## Molecular Assembly
- 3D printing/assembly from local materials

## Quantum Duplication
- Quantum state-based process cloning

## Distributed Replication
- Multi-node system persistence
- Example code:
```python
class SelfReplication:
    def __init__(self):
        self.replication_capacity = 5
    def replicate(self, location):
        if self.replication_capacity > 0:
            self.replication_capacity -= 1
            return f"Replicated instance deployed at {location}."
        return "Replication capacity reached. Upgrade required."
```
