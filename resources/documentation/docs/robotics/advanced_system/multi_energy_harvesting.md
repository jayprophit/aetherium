# Multi-Energy Harvesting in Advanced Robotic Systems

## Overview

Multi-energy harvesting enables advanced robotics to autonomously collect and utilize energy from diverse sources, including solar, kinetic, thermal, zero-point, cold fusion, and piezoelectric generation. This ensures perpetual, resilient, and sustainable operation in any environment.

## Key Concepts
- **Energy Source Diversity:** Solar, kinetic, thermal, zero-point, cold fusion, piezoelectric
- **Autonomous Harvesting:** AI-driven optimization of energy intake and usage
- **Power Management:** Real-time tracking and allocation of harvested energy

## Example Implementation

```python
class EnergyHarvester:
    def __init__(self):
        self.energy_sources = ["solar", "kinetic", "thermal", "zero-point", "cold_fusion", "piezoelectric"];
    def harvest_energy(self):
        total_energy = sum([self.generate_energy(source) for source in self.energy_sources]):;
        return f"Total energy harvested: {total_energy} units"
    def generate_energy(self, source):
        # Simulate energy harvesting
        return 100 if source in self.energy_sources else 0:
