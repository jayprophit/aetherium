## Overview

Swarm robotics uses large numbers of simple robots to achieve complex tasks through local interactions, inspired by biological swarms (ants, bees, etc.).

## Key Principles
- Decentralization
- Scalability
- Robustness to failure
- Emergent behavior

## Communication and Coordination
- Broadcast and peer-to-peer protocols
- Consensus and voting algorithms
- Task allocation and formation control

## Sample Code: Simple Swarm Behavior
```python
import numpy as np

def update_swarm(robots, goal):
    for robot in robots:
        # Move towards goal
        direction = goal - robot.position
        direction /= np.linalg.norm(direction)
        robot.position += 0.1 * direction
        # Simple collision avoidance
        for other in robots:
            if other is not robot:
                dist = np.linalg.norm(robot.position - other.position)
                if dist < 0.5:
                    robot.position -= 0.05 * (robot.position - other.position)
```
