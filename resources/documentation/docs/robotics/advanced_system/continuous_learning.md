## Overview

Continuous learning enables robots to adapt to new environments, tasks, and user preferences over time. This is achieved through online learning, experience replay, and adaptive control.

## Continuous Learning Concepts
- **Online learning**: Update models incrementally as new data arrives
- **Experience replay**: Store and reuse past experiences to improve learning
- **Self-supervised learning**: Generate labels from the robot's own actions and environment
- **Meta-learning**: Learn how to learn, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks

## Implementation Strategies
- Use reinforcement learning with experience replay buffers
- Apply continual learning algorithms to avoid catastrophic forgetting
- Integrate user feedback for supervised adaptation
- Periodically retrain models with new data

## Code Examples

### Experience Replay Buffer
```python
from collections import deque
import random

class ExperienceReplay:
    def __init__(self, capacity=10000):
        self.buffer = deque(maxlen=capacity)
    def add(self, experience):
        self.buffer.append(experience)
    def sample(self, batch_size):
        return random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)
```

### Online Model Update
```python
def online_update(model, new_data, optimizer, loss_fn):
    model.train()
    for x, y in new_data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(output, y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

## Best Practices
- Regularly validate performance to avoid drift
- Use memory-efficient buffer management
- Monitor for concept drift and adapt learning rates
- Safeguard against catastrophic forgetting
