## Overview

Disaster recovery and backup are essential for maintaining system integrity and minimizing downtime after failures, attacks, or accidents.

## Disaster Recovery Planning
- Develop recovery protocols for hardware and software failures
- Maintain hardware and software redundancies
- Define emergency shut-off and restart procedures
- Regularly test disaster recovery plans

## Backup Strategies
- Automatic and scheduled data backups (local and cloud)
- Versioned backups for critical data and configs
- Secure backup storage (encryption, access control)
- Regular backup verification and restore testing

## Implementation Examples

### Python: Cloud Backup Script
```python
import boto3
import os

def backup_to_s3(local_dir, bucket_name):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(local_dir):
        for file in files:
            local_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            s3_path = os.path.relpath(local_path, local_dir)
            s3.upload_file(local_path, bucket_name, s3_path)

# Example usage:
# backup_to_s3('/robot/data', 'my-robot-backups')
```

### Emergency Protocol Example
- Emergency stop button wired to main power relay
- Watchdog timer for automatic reboot after crash
- Redundant power supplies and network interfaces

## Best Practices
- Document and regularly update recovery plans
- Test restore procedures at scheduled intervals
- Use multi-region cloud backups for critical data
- Train staff on disaster protocols
