# 3D Blockchain System Design and Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the architecture, features, and usage of a novel 3D blockchain system capable of supporting fiat and cryptocurrencies, DeFi, referral schemes, capital gains tax, and more. The blockchain operates in a 3D space (X, Y, Z axes), enabling multi-dimensional data structures, plug-and-play APIs, and compatibility with all platforms (mobile, desktop, dApp, web3, etc.). Each website or dApp can be stored as encrypted blocks, with each site having its own blockchain address.

## Features

- **3D Blockchain Ledger:** Blocks are positioned in (X, Y, Z) space, enabling complex relationships and spider-web-like structure.
- **Fiat & Crypto Support:** Handles both cryptocurrency and fiat transactions, with smart contracts and off-chain conversion APIs.
- **Mining, Staking, Minting:** Supports PoW, PoS, and NFT minting.
- **Plug-and-Play APIs:** REST API and SDKs for integration with any platform.
- **DeFi Integration:** Supports lending, borrowing, staking, liquidity pools, and on-chain swaps (see [layer2_and_defi.py](../../src/blockchain/layer2_and_defi.py)).
- **Layer-2 Fast Transactions:** State channels, rollups, and dynamic fee adjustment for cheap, scalable transactions ([layer2_and_defi.md](layer2_and_defi.md)).
- **Cross-Chain Bridges:** HTLC-based atomic swaps and asset conversion across blockchains.
- **Referral & Pyramid Schemes:** Smart contracts and referral system for bonuses and multi-level distribution.
- **Capital Gains Tax:** Built-in calculation and reporting tools.
- **Web3 & Website-on-Chain:** Websites can be encrypted into blocks, each with a unique blockchain address.
- **3D Visualization:** Compatible with 3D visualization tools (e.g., Three.js).

## Architecture

- **Block Structure:** Each block contains X, Y, Z coordinates, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, and metadata.
- **Consensus:** Supports PoW, PoS, and hybrid models.
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints for block management, mining, staking, and integration.
- **Smart Contracts:** For DeFi, referral, and tax features.

## Example Python Implementation

See `src/blockchain/3d_blockchain.py` for the foundational code.

## Example Solidity Referral Contract

See `src/blockchain/contracts/referral_system.sol` for a sample smart contract.

## Integration

- **API Usage:** See `src/blockchain/3d_blockchain_api.py` for REST API endpoints.
- **SDKs:** Extendable for mobile, desktop, and web.
