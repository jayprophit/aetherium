# Knowledge Base Documentation

This documentation hub contains all core, module, and cross-disciplinary documentation for the knowledge-base system. All content is version-controlled, cross-linked, and structured for both human and machine consumption.

---

## Core Documentation Structure
- System design, architecture, and workflow
- Module and feature documentation (ERP, AI/ML, blockchain, device, etc.)
- API, deployment, and integration guides
- Knowledge, theory, and cross-genre inspiration

---

## Cross-Disciplinary Inspiration & Knowledge Integration
The knowledge-base integrates inspiration and references from:
- Theories, ideas, and scientific papers
- Films, movies, TV series, anime, and animation
- Books, comics, and audio books
- Documentaries and cross-genre media

**How to Contribute:**
- Add new cross-genre knowledge in `/knowledge/cross_genre/` (see subdirectories for films, books, comics, etc.)
- Add new patents, theories, or ideas in `/knowledge/patents/` and `/knowledge/theories/` and `/knowledge/ideas/`
- Cross-link new content with related modules and documentation for maximum impact
- Reference `/knowledge/cross_genre/EXAMPLE_ENTRY.md` for a template

**Example:**
- See `/knowledge/cross_genre/README.md` and `/knowledge/patents/README.md` for inspiration and best practices

---

## Documentation Workflow
- All new data, modules, and features must be documented here
- Ensure all documentation is cross-linked and referenced in the main README and module docs
- Remove obsolete or duplicate files and merge content as needed
- Re-allocate or move files/folders to maintain logical structure
- Use the quality checklist in `/development/maintenance/quality_checklist.md` and maintenance scripts in `/development/scripts/` to validate and maintain documentation quality
