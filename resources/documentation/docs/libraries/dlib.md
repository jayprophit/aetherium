# dlib Library

## Overview
[dlib](http://dlib.net/) is a modern C++ toolkit with Python bindings for machine learning, computer vision, and facial recognition. It is widely used for face detection, object recognition, and image processing.

## Installation
```sh
pip install dlib
```

## Example Usage
```python
import dlib
# Load a pre-trained face detector
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
image = dlib.load_rgb_image("your_image.jpg")
detections = detector(image, 1)
print(f"Detected {len(detections)} faces.")
```

## Integration Notes
- Used for facial recognition, object detection, and shape prediction in the assistant.
- Often combined with opencv-python and face_recognition.
