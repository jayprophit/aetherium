# IoT Systems

This documentation covers Internet of Things (IoT) systems integration with the knowledge base, including device management, protocols, sensors, security, and edge computing.

## Overview

The IoT module provides components and frameworks for connecting, managing, and processing data from IoT devices within the knowledge base ecosystem. It enables seamless integration of physical devices with AI and data processing capabilities.

### Key Features

- Device management and discovery
- Protocol support (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP)
- Sensor data collection and processing
- Security and authentication
- Edge computing capabilities
- Data synchronization and persistence
- Integration with AI and analytics

## Architecture

The IoT framework follows a layered architecture:

1. **Device Layer**: Physical IoT devices with sensors and actuators
2. **Communication Layer**: Protocols for device-to-system communication
3. **Management Layer**: Device registration, discovery, and monitoring
4. **Data Processing Layer**: Edge computing and data preprocessing
5. **Security Layer**: Authentication, encryption, and access control
6. **Integration Layer**: Connection to AI, analytics, and knowledge base

## Modules

### Device Management

The device management module handles device registration, discovery, monitoring, and lifecycle management. It provides a centralized registry of all connected devices and their capabilities.

- [Device Registration](device_management/registration.md)
- [Device Discovery](device_management/discovery.md)
- [Device Monitoring](device_management/monitoring.md)
- [Device Configuration](device_management/configuration.md)
- [Firmware Updates](device_management/firmware.md)

### Protocols

The protocols module implements support for common IoT communication protocols, ensuring interoperability with a wide range of devices and systems.

- [MQTT](protocols/mqtt.md) - Lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol
- [CoAP](protocols/coap.md) - Constrained Application Protocol for resource-constrained devices
- [HTTP/REST](protocols/http.md) - HTTP-based communication for web-enabled devices
- [WebSockets](protocols/websockets.md) - Bidirectional real-time communication
- [AMQP](protocols/amqp.md) - Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

### Sensors

The sensors module provides interfaces and implementations for different types of sensors, along with data collection and processing capabilities.

- [Sensor Types](sensors/types.md)
- [Sensor Data Collection](sensors/data_collection.md)
- [Calibration](sensors/calibration.md)
- [Data Validation](sensors/validation.md)
- [Sensor Fusion](sensors/fusion.md)

### Security

The security module ensures that IoT devices and data are protected from unauthorized access and other security threats.

- [Authentication](security/authentication.md)
- [Authorization](security/authorization.md)
- [Encryption](security/encryption.md)
- [Key Management](security/key_management.md)
- [Secure Boot](security/secure_boot.md)
- [Intrusion Detection](security/intrusion_detection.md)

### Edge Computing

The edge computing module enables data processing at or near the source of data generation, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements.

- [Edge Processing](edge_computing/processing.md)
- [Edge Analytics](edge_computing/analytics.md)
- [Local Storage](edge_computing/storage.md)
- [Edge-to-Cloud Synchronization](edge_computing/synchronization.md)
- [Resource Management](edge_computing/resource_management.md)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Network connectivity
- Access to IoT devices or simulators

### Installation

```bash
pip install knowledge-base-iot
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from iot.device_management.device_manager import DeviceManager
from iot.protocols.mqtt_client import MQTTClient

# Initialize device manager
device_manager = DeviceManager()

# Connect to MQTT broker
mqtt_client = MQTTClient("client-001", "mqtt.example.com")
mqtt_client.connect()

# Register a device
device_id = device_manager.register_device({
    "name": "Temperature Sensor",
    "type": "sensor",
    "location": "Building A, Room 101"
})

# Subscribe to device data
mqtt_client.subscribe(f"devices/{device_id}/data", callback=process_data)

# Function to process incoming data
def process_data(topic, payload):
    print(f"Received data: {payload}")
    # Process and store data
    device_manager.update_device_status(device_id, payload)
```

## Integration Examples

### Integration with AI

```python
from iot.device_management.device_manager import DeviceManager
from iot.sensors.sensor_interface import SensorArray
from ai.machine_learning.predictive_models import PredictiveModel

# Set up device and sensors
device_manager = DeviceManager()
sensor_array = SensorArray("Environment Sensors")

# Add sensors to array
sensor_array.add_sensor(TemperatureSensor())
sensor_array.add_sensor(HumiditySensor())

# Register with device manager
device = device_manager.create_device("environment_monitor")
device.sensors = sensor_array.sensors

# Create predictive model for anomaly detection
model = PredictiveModel("anomaly_detection")
model.load("models/environment_anomaly.pkl")

# Process sensor data with AI model
sensor_data = device.get_sensor_data()
anomalies = model.predict(sensor_data)
:
if anomalies:
    print(f"Anomalies detected: {anomalies}")
    # Take appropriate action
```

### Integration with Knowledge Base

```python
from iot.device_management.device_manager import DeviceManager
from knowledge_base.client import KnowledgeBaseClient

# Set up device manager and knowledge base client
device_manager = DeviceManager()
kb_client = KnowledgeBaseClient("https://kb-api.example.com", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Get device data
device = device_manager.get_device("device-001")
device_data = device.update_status()

# Store device data in knowledge base
article_id = kb_client.create_article({
    "title": f"Device Data: {device.name}",
    "content": json.dumps(device_data, indent=2),
    "category_id": "iot_data",
    "tags": ["iot", "device_data", device.device_type]
})

# Link device data to related knowledge articles
related_articles = kb_client.search(f"troubleshooting {device.device_type}")
kb_client.create_relationship(article_id, [art["id"] for art in related_articles]):
```
