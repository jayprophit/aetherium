- `/categories` — List available knowledge base categories.
- `/generate_code` — Generate code from a prompt (AI-powered).
- `/analyze_multimodal` — Analyze uploaded images/audio/files (multimodal AI).

### Web Search & Scraping
- `/web-search` — Anonymous web search (Tor/Brave/DuckDuckGo/SerpAPI).
- `/extract-content` — Extract and parse content from a web page.
- `/scrape` — (Planned) Advanced web scraping and data extraction.

### Web Automation
- `/automate` (POST) — Run browser automation tasks (Playwright/Selenium):
  - **Payload:** `{ url, actions, selectors, script, headless, use_playwright }`
  - **Actions:** `goto`, `fill_form`, `click`, `screenshot`, `run_script`, `get_content`

## Modules
- `main.py` — FastAPI app, all endpoints
- `web_search.py` — Tor/Brave/Decentralized search, content extraction
- `web_scraper.py` — Advanced scraping and data analysis
- `web_automation.py` — Browser automation (Playwright/Selenium)
- `networking.py` — VPN, DNS, VOIP, diagnostics

## Setup & Usage
- Requires Python 3.9+, FastAPI, Playwright/Selenium, requests, etc.
- For VPN/DNS/VOIP, external binaries or system permissions may be needed.
- See each module for advanced usage and extension points.

## Security & Privacy
- CORS enabled for cross-platform clients
- Tor and VPN support for anonymous/secure operations
- No authentication by default (add before production)

## Extending
