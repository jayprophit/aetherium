# Networking Module — Knowledge Base Assistant

This module provides backend support for advanced networking, privacy, and communication features.

## Features
- **VPN Integration**: Connect to OpenVPN or WireGuard VPNs for secure, private networking.
- **DNS Customization**: Set system DNS or use DNS-over-HTTPS/DNS-over-TLS for privacy.
- **VOIP (Voice over IP)**: Start a SIP/WebRTC client (stub for future integration).
- **Diagnostics**: Query basic network status and IP info.

## API Endpoints
- `POST /vpn/connect` — Connect to a VPN. Payload: `{ config_path, vpn_type }`
- `POST /dns/set` — Set DNS servers. Payload: `{ nameservers, method }`
- `POST /voip/start` — Start a VOIP client. Payload: `{ sip_account }`
- `GET /network/status` — Get network diagnostics.

## Usage
- These endpoints are designed for agent-driven and user-driven secure networking.
- For real VPN/VOIP/DNS changes, backend must run with appropriate permissions.
- Stubs provided for future expansion (see code for extension points).

## Extending
- Add additional VPN protocols, DNS providers, or VOIP integrations as needed.
- Integrate with system/network monitoring for advanced diagnostics.
