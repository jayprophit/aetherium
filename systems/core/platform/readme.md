# Core Platform

This directory contains the central platform components that provide the foundation for the knowledge base system.

## Overview

The core platform serves as the backbone of the system, providing essential services and infrastructure that enable other components to function. It's designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled and can be developed independently
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and capabilities
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Security**: Built with security best practices in mind

## Architecture

### Core Services

1. **API Gateway**
   - Request routing
   - Authentication & Authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - Request/Response transformation

2. **Service Registry**
   - Service discovery
   - Health monitoring
   - Load balancing

3. **Message Bus**
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Pub/Sub messaging
   - Event sourcing

4. **Storage Layer**
   - Database management
   - Caching
   - File storage
