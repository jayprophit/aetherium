# Security Framework

This directory contains the security infrastructure and protocols for the knowledge base system, ensuring data protection, access control, and secure communications.

## Security Principles

- **Confidentiality**: Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access
- **Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy and prevent unauthorized modifications
- **Availability**: Maintain reliable access to systems and data
- **Accountability**: Track and audit all security-relevant actions
- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- API key management
- Session management

### 2. Authorization
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Policy management
- Permission validation

### 3. Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Key management
- Data masking
- Tokenization

### 4. Network Security
- Firewall rules
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- DDoS protection
- VPN and secure tunnels

## Security Best Practices

### Secure Development
- Regular security training for developers
- Secure coding standards
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code review requirements

### Infrastructure Security
- Regular security patching
- Principle of least privilege
- Network segmentation
- Secure configuration baselines

### Monitoring & Response
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Incident response plan
- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- OpenSSL 3.0+
- Vault 1.12+ (for secrets management)
- Kubernetes 1.24+ (for container security)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository

cd knowledge-base/systems/core/security

# Install security dependencies
make install-deps

# Generate TLS certificates
make certs DOMAIN=example.com

# Start security services
make start
```
