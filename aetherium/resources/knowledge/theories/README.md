## Example Theory: Emergent Intelligence in Large Language Models

**Summary:**
As LLMs scale in size and data, they exhibit emergent behaviors not present in smaller models, such as in-context learning and reasoning. This theory explores the threshold and mechanisms for such emergence.

**Implications:**
- Guides the design of plugin orchestration and RAG
- Informs future research on model scaling and safety
