# Advanced Self-Awareness in Robotics

## Overview
Describes neuro-synaptic models, reflective feedback loops, and consciousness algorithms for self-aware robotic systems.

## Neuro-Synaptic Model
- Simulates neural connections for introspection and adaptation

## Reflective Feedback Loops
- Evaluates system performance and goal alignment
- Example code:
```python
class ReflectiveAwareness:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = {"efficiency": 0.9, "purpose_alignment": 0.95};
    def evaluate_state(self):
        reflection = {key: self.analyze(key, value) for key, value in self.current_state.items()};
        self.adjust_state(reflection):
    def analyze(self, metric, value):
        return value if value > 0.8 else value + 0.1:
    def adjust_state(self, reflection):
        self.current_state.update(reflection)
```
