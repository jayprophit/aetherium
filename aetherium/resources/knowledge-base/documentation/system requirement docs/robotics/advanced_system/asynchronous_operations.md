# Asynchronous Operations in Advanced Robotics

## Overview
Parallelized processing and event-driven task management to maximize throughput and minimize bottlenecks in robotic systems.

## Features
- Parallel task execution using event loops or multithreading
- Asynchronous I/O for sensor and actuator data
- Task scheduling and prioritization

## Example Code
```python
import asyncio

async def sensor_read():
    # Simulate asynchronous sensor reading
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return "Sensor data"

async def actuator_command():
    # Simulate asynchronous actuator command
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    return "Actuator command executed"

async def main():
    sensor = await sensor_read()
    actuator = await actuator_command()
    print(sensor, actuator)

# asyncio.run(main())
```
