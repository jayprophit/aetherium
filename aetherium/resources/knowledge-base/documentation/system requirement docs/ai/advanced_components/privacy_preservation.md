# Privacy-Preserving Computation Layer

## Core Components

### 1. Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
- **Implementation**:
  - Supports computation on encrypted data without decryption
  - Enables secure processing of sensitive information
  - Libraries: Microsoft SEAL, OpenFHE, PALISADE

### 2. Federated Learning
- **Implementation**:
  - Decentralized model training across devices/organizations
  - Preserves data locality and privacy
  - Frameworks: TensorFlow Federated, PySyft, FATE

### 3. Differential Privacy (DP)
- **Implementation**:
  - Adds controlled noise to query responses
  - Prevents re-identification in datasets
  - Libraries: Google DP, OpenDP, IBM Differential Privacy Library

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols
- Zero-knowledge proofs for verification

### Access Control
- Attribute-based encryption (ABE)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permission systems

## Performance Considerations

### Throughput Optimization
- Batch processing of encrypted operations
- Hardware acceleration (FPGA/ASIC) for HE operations
- Parallel computation across distributed nodes

### Latency Management
- Caching of frequently accessed encrypted data
- Progressive model updates in federated learning
- Adaptive privacy budgets in DP implementations

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Data Encryption
```python
from seal import EncryptionParameters, scheme_type, CoeffModulus, Encryptor

def setup_he_encryption():
    parms = EncryptionParameters(scheme_type.bfv)
    parms.set_poly_modulus_degree(4096)
    parms.set_coeff_modulus(CoeffModulus.BFVDefault(4096))
    parms.set_plain_modulus(256)
    return parms
```text
```python
import tensorflow_federated as tff

@tff.federated_computation
def federated_average(model_weights):
    return tff.federated_mean(model_weights)
```text
```python
from diffprivlib.models import LogisticRegression

dp_model = LogisticRegression(
    epsilon=1.0,  # Privacy budget
    data_norm=5.0,
    max_iter=1000
)
```

## Compliance & Standards
- GDPR compliance for data protection
- HIPAA compliance for healthcare data
- FIPS 140-2/3 for cryptographic modules

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with quantum-resistant cryptography
- Automated privacy budget management
- Cross-silo federated learning with secure aggregation
