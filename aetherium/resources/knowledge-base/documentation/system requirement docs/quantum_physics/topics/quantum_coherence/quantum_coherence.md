# Quantum Coherence

## Overview

Quantum coherence is a fundamental property of quantum systems that allows them to exist in superpositions of different states and exhibit interference effects. It is essential for quantum computing, quantum information processing, and many quantum technologies.

## Key Concepts

### Coherent Superposition

A quantum system is in a coherent superposition if it can be described by:

$$|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |\phi_i\rangle$$

where $\sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1$ and the relative phases between terms are well-defined.

### Density Matrix Formalism

Coherence can be quantified using the density matrix $\rho$:

$$\rho = \sum_{i,j} \rho_{ij} |i\rangle\langle j|$$

where off-diagonal elements $\rho_{ij}$ ($i \neq j$) represent quantum coherence.

### Coherence Time

The characteristic time $T_2$ during which a quantum system maintains its coherence before decoherence effects dominate.
