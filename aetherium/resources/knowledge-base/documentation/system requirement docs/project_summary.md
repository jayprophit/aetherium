# Project Summary & Handoff: Knowledge Base AI Assistant

## Overview
A unified, production-grade, cross-platform AI assistant system supporting web, mobile, desktop, and IoT. Features advanced AI, multimodal, search, automation, networking, and extensible agent modules, with robust monitoring, analytics, CI/CD, and world-class documentation.

## Architecture Highlights
- **Backend:** FastAPI microservices, modular database (vector, document, relational), agent orchestration, web scraping, automation, VPN/DNS/VOIP, Prometheus metrics, Sentry error tracking.
- **Frontend:** React (web), React Native (mobile), Electron (desktop), responsive UI/UX, iframe previews, unified tech stack integration.
- **Deployment:** Netlify, Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD, production-ready configs, ENV-based secrets, rollback & backup.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint, Grafana dashboard-ready, Sentry for error tracking.
- **Agents:** Modular agent system (codegen, custom, workflow), easy extension for LLMs, search, automation.

## Key Features
- Knowledge base search & retrieval
- Code generation (LLM/AI agent-powered)
- Multimodal analysis (image, audio, video)
- Web & decentralized search (Tor, Presearch, YaCy)
- Web automation (Playwright/Selenium)
- Secure networking (VPN, DNS, VOIP)
- Advanced metadata, SEO, and documentation management
- Monitoring & analytics (Prometheus, Sentry, logging)
- CI/CD, automated tests, linting, deployment, alerting
- World-class, responsive UI/UX across platforms

## Monitoring & Analytics
- **Prometheus:** Scrape `/metrics` endpoint (see `prometheus_metrics.py`).
- **Grafana:** Connect to Prometheus for dashboards (sample dashboard JSON included below).
- **Sentry:** Add SENTRY_DSN to ENV, errors auto-captured (see `sentry_integration.py`).

### Sample Grafana Dashboard JSON
```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "panels": [
      { "type": "graph", "title": "Request Rate", "targets": [{ "expr": "http_requests_total" }] },
      { "type": "graph", "title": "Error Rate", "targets": [{ "expr": "http_requests_total{status=\"500\"}" }] },
      { "type": "stat", "title": "Active Users", "targets": [{ "expr": "active_users" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Agent Example: CodeGenAgent
- See `backend/src/agents/codegen_agent.py` and registration in `main.py`.
- Extend for LLM, OpenAI, or custom code generation.
- Exposed at `/generate_code` endpoint.

## CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml`.
- Runs tests, lint, build, deploy, and alerts on failure.
- Trigger by pushing to `main` or opening PR.

## Deployment
- **Netlify:** For web frontend (see Netlify docs).
- **Docker:** For backend/microservices (see Dockerfile/sample-compose).
- **ENV:** Set secrets (API keys, SENTRY_DSN, DB URIs) in deployment environment.

## Handoff Checklist
- [x] All features implemented & tested
- [x] Monitoring & analytics enabled
- [x] CI/CD pipeline active
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Ready for production launch

## Next Steps
- Monitor logs, metrics, and Sentry for real-world usage
- Continue documentation and feature updates as needed
- Use agent template for new AI/automation modules
