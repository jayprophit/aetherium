# Mobile Development

This documentation covers mobile application development for the knowledge base system, including native app development, cross-platform frameworks, UI/UX design, performance optimization, and security considerations.

## Overview

The mobile module provides components and tools for building mobile applications that interact with the knowledge base. It supports both native development (iOS/Android) and cross-platform frameworks.

### Key Features

- Cross-platform mobile application framework integration
- Multimodal data capture from mobile devices
- Knowledge base API client for mobile environments
- Offline data synchronization
- Mobile-optimized UI components
- Device feature access (camera, microphone, sensors)
- Push notification integration
- Authentication and security

## Getting Started

To begin developing mobile applications that integrate with the knowledge base:

1. Set up the development environment for your preferred platform
2. Install the necessary dependencies
3. Configure API access to the knowledge base
4. Follow the guides for your specific use case

## Supported Platforms

- iOS (Swift, Objective-C)
- Android (Kotlin, Java)
- React Native
- Flutter
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

## Core Components

### App.js

The main entry point for the mobile application. It sets up navigation, authentication, and global state management.

### MultimodalCapture.js

A component for capturing multimodal data (images, audio, text) from mobile devices and sending it to the knowledge base for processing.
