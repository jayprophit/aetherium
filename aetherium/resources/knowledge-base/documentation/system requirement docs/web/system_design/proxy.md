# Proxy and Reverse Proxy in System Design

## Overview

A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and servers. A reverse proxy sits in front of backend servers and forwards client requests to them.

## Types
- **Forward Proxy:** Forwards client requests to the internet (used for filtering, privacy, caching)
- **Reverse Proxy:** Receives requests from the internet and forwards them to internal servers (used for load balancing, SSL termination, security)

## Use Cases
- Web filtering and content control
- Caching and performance optimization
- Hiding internal network structure
- SSL/TLS termination
- Load balancing
- DDoS protection

## Example: NGINX Reverse Proxy
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

## Best Practices
- Use reverse proxies for scalability and security
- Terminate SSL at the proxy when possible
- Monitor proxy logs for anomalies
