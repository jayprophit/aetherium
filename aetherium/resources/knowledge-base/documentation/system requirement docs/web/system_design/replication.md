# Replication in System Design

## Overview

Replication is the process of copying data from one database server to another to improve availability, fault tolerance, and performance.

## Types of Replication
- **Master-Slave (Primary-Replica):** Writes go to master, reads from replicas
- **Master-Master:** All nodes can accept writes (conflict resolution needed)
- **Synchronous/Asynchronous:** Trade-off between consistency and performance

## Use Cases
- High availability
- Load balancing for read-heavy workloads
- Disaster recovery

## Example: PostgreSQL Streaming Replication
```sql
-- On primary server
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 3
-- On replica
standby_mode = on
primary_conninfo = 'host=primary_ip user=replicator password=secret'
```

## Best Practices
- Monitor replication lag
- Use automated failover
- Secure replication channels
