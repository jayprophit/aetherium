# Performance Tuning in AI Systems

This guide outlines strategies and best practices for optimizing the performance of AI and machine learning systems.

## Key Strategies

- **Model Quantization**: Reduce model size and increase inference speed by quantizing weights.
- **Pruning**: Remove redundant neurons or layers from neural networks.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Use GPUs, TPUs, or specialized accelerators for faster computation.
- **Batch Processing**: Process data in batches to maximize throughput.
- **Efficient Data Pipelines**: Streamline data input/output to reduce bottlenecks.

## Example: Quantization with PyTorch

```python
import torch
from torch.quantization import quantize_dynamic

model = ...  # Your trained model
quantized_model = quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)
```

## Best Practices

- Profile your models to identify bottlenecks before tuning.
- Use mixed-precision training for faster training and lower memory usage.
- Deploy models using optimized runtimes (e.g., ONNX Runtime, TensorRT).
