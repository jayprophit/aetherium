## Permission Details

### Permission Naming Convention
Permissions follow a hierarchical naming pattern:
```
<resource>:<action>:<specific_resource>
```

**Examples:**
- `quantum:execute` - Execute quantum circuits
- `quantum:circuit:create` - Create quantum circuits
- `quantum:results:read` - Read quantum results
- `iot:device:control` - Control IoT devices

### Permission Hierarchy
- `*` - Wildcard permission (full access)
- `read` - View/read access
- `create` - Create new resources
- `update` - Modify existing resources
- `delete` - Remove resources
- `execute` - Run operations
- `control` - Administrative control

## Role Assignment and Management

### Default Role Assignment
New users are assigned the `user` role by default. Role upgrades require approval from a `system_admin`.

### Role Inheritance
Roles can inherit permissions from lower-level roles:
```
system_admin -> quantum_researcher -> user -> guest
```

### Dynamic Role Assignment
Roles can be assigned based on:
- User registration information
- Organization affiliation
- Project membership
- Approval workflows

## Security Contexts

### Resource Ownership
Users can only modify resources they own, unless they have elevated permissions.

### Multi-tenancy
The platform supports multiple organizations with isolated resources:
- Organization-level role assignment
- Resource isolation between organizations
- Shared resources with explicit permissions

### Time-based Permissions
Permissions can have time-based restrictions:
- Session timeouts
- Role expiration dates
- Temporary elevated access

## API Security

### Authentication Requirements
All API endpoints require authentication except:
- `/health` - System health check
- `/docs` - Public API documentation
- `/auth/login` - Authentication endpoint

### Rate Limiting
Rate limits are applied per user and role:
- `guest`: 10 requests/minute
- `user`: 100 requests/minute
- `researcher`: 500 requests/minute
- `*_engineer/*_manager`: 1000 requests/minute
- `system_admin`: 10000 requests/minute

### Permission Validation
Every API request is validated against:
1. Valid JWT token
2. Required permissions for the endpoint
3. Resource ownership (if applicable)
4. Rate limits
5. IP restrictions (if configured)

## Audit and Compliance

### Activity Logging
All user actions are logged with:
- User ID and role
- Action performed
- Resource affected
- Timestamp
- IP address
- Success/failure status

### Permission Changes
Role and permission changes are:
- Logged with full audit trail
- Require approval workflows
- Include justification and approver information
- Generate security alerts

### Regular Access Reviews
- Quarterly role and permission reviews
- Automated alerts for inactive accounts
- Regular security assessments
- Compliance reporting

## Implementation Guidelines

### Backend Implementation
```python
# Example permission check
@require_permission("quantum:execute")
async def execute_quantum_circuit(circuit_id: str, current_user: User):
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Role-based access
@require_role(["quantum_researcher", "system_admin"])
async def advanced_quantum_operation():
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Frontend Implementation
```typescript
// Example permission check in React
const { hasPermission } = useAuth();

{hasPermission('quantum:execute') && (
    <ExecuteButton onClick={handleExecute} />
)}

// Role-based UI
const { hasRole } = useAuth();

{hasRole(['system_admin', 'iot_manager']) && (
    <AdminPanel />
)}
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Roles table
CREATE TABLE roles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Permissions table
CREATE TABLE permissions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    resource VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

-- User roles (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    role_id UUID REFERENCES roles(id),
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    assigned_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id)
);

-- Role permissions (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE role_permissions (
    role_id UUID REFERENCES roles(id),
    permission_id UUID REFERENCES permissions(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (role_id, permission_id)
);
```

## Best Practices

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimum permissions required for job function
- Regular review and removal of unnecessary permissions
- Use role-based rather than user-based permissions

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Frontend and backend permission validation
- Database-level access controls
- Network-level restrictions

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time security alerts
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Regular security assessments
- Compliance monitoring and reporting

This role and permission system ensures that the Quantum AI Platform maintains the highest security standards while providing appropriate access levels for different user types and use cases.
