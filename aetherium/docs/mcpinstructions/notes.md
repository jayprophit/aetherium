**Note:** In this context, "brain/plan" refers to any chat, program, platform, or software that uses its own plan internally. This ensures there is no confusion, and any system can adopt this plan structure for its own internal workflow.

- Strict requirement: Any change to one of the main files ([README.md], [architecture.md], [changelog.md], [memories.md], [method.md], [plan.md], [rollback.md], [system_design.md], [FIXME.md], [TODO.md], [checklist.md]) must be reflected in all others, both before and after any process. All files must be cross-linked and referenced. All data and code must be validated for correct formatting and correctness.

## Notes
- User wants to build a knowledge base with interconnected documentation for ML workflow steps.
- Each workflow step should have individual documentation for reuse in other areas.
- Steps to cover: Data Acquisition, Preprocessing, Splitting the Data, Build + Train Model, Evaluate Performance, Hyperparameter Tuning, Deployment.
- User provided detailed information for Microsoft BITNET B1.58 2B4T model and wants it added to the knowledge base.
- The knowledge base should be regularly updated and changes pushed to the GitHub repository.
- User will be merging legacy data/designs into the new knowledge base and updating data pathways for future program development.
- The plan should be synchronized/merged with the knowledge base plan so both share the same data, supporting continuity across sessions.
- README.md and changelog should be automatically updated to track new/old changes across the knowledge base, including files and folders.

- New note: Robotics perception and depth estimation documentation files (docs/robotics/advanced_system/perception/README.md and depth_estimation.md) have been created and are now fully populated with system architecture, deep learning code, sensor fusion, and implementation examples.
- New note: Begin and integrate documentation for advanced robotics control systems, localization and navigation, human-robot interaction, swarm robotics, and testing/validation frameworks as requested. Ensure all perception/vision/depth modules (MiDaS/DPT, OpenCV SGBM, Open3D, quantization, obstacle detection) are included, cross-linked, and referenced in the robotics documentation suite.
- New note: Begin a new deep analysis scan of the knowledge_base to identify any undocumented data or components. For every missing or undocumented item, create and integrate comprehensive documentation, ensuring all links, references, and cross-links are present. This includes new documentation for advanced robotic system enhancements: UI/UX, energy management, networking/security, localization/navigation, modularity, learning/adaptation, swarm robotics, ethics/compliance, disaster recovery, testing/validation, and any other areas identified as missing or needing expansion. Incorporate implementation plans, architectural diagrams, hardware/software breakdowns, and operational guidelines as appropriate.
- New note: Deep analysis scan requested for all undocumented data/components, with explicit instruction to add documentation and code for any missing areas, ensuring all links and references are present.
- New note: User requested implementation and documentation of a comprehensive virtual brain scan system that maps and models all brain functions, regions, and processes (consciousness, creativity, emotion, learning, etc.), including 3D modeling, neural simulation, cognitive/emotional/creative modules, and integration with the knowledge base. Code and cross-linking required.
- New task: Deep analysis scan for undocumented data/components in the knowledge base; for each gap, add documentation and code, ensuring all links and references are complete
- New task: Implement and document a comprehensive virtual brain scan system (3D brain model, neural simulation, cognitive/emotional/creative modules, code, documentation, cross-linking)
  - [x] Implement Python code for virtual brain scan system and integrate with documentation
- New note: Virtual brain scan system documentation exists in docs/ai/virtual_brain (01_architecture_overview.md, 02_cognitive_functions.md), but Python code implementation is missing and must be created and integrated.
- New note: Python code implementation for the virtual brain scan system (src/ai/virtual_brain.py) and integrated documentation (docs/ai/virtual_brain/03_python_implementation.md) have been created and cross-linked. All navigation and references are now present.
- New note: User requested comprehensive implementation and documentation for self-awareness and the full human emotional spectrum (compassion, guilt, happiness, joy, sadness, likes, dislikes, sorrow, confusion, confidence, etc.), including introspection, empathy, emotional conflict resolution, reinforcement learning, emotional memory, and behavioral adaptation. This must include neural network-based emotion modeling, emotional memory, empathy/sympathy, behavioral adaptation, and cross-linked documentation/code examples. Deep scan and integration required across all relevant modules.
- New task: Deep analysis scan and implementation for comprehensive emotional intelligence/self-awareness system (full emotional spectrum, introspection, empathy, emotional memory, reinforcement learning, behavioral adaptation, documentation, code, cross-linking)
