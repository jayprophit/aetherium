# Contribution Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the process for contributing to the knowledge base, ensuring consistency, quality, and proper integration of new content.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Planning Your Contribution
Before creating new content, consider:
- Does this topic already exist in the knowledge base?
- Where does this content fit within the existing architecture?
- What existing documents should this new content reference?
- What templates should be used?

### 2. Content Creation
1. **Select the appropriate template**:
   - General documentation: [Document Template](../templates/document_template.md)
   - ML model documentation: [Model Template](../templates/model_template.md)
   - Workflow step documentation: [Workflow Template](../templates/workflow_template.md)

2. **Follow naming conventions**:
   - Use lowercase with underscores for filenames: `file_name.md`
   - Be descriptive but concise
   - Include the topic category in multi-word filenames: `preprocessing_techniques.md` instead of just `techniques.md`

3. **Place in the correct directory** according to [Architecture](../architecture.md)

4. **Fill all required sections** from the template

### 3. Content Quality Guidelines

#### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Define acronyms and technical terms on first use
- Use active voice where possible
- Keep paragraphs focused and relatively short
- Use proper Markdown formatting

#### Code Examples
- Include descriptive comments
- Follow language-specific style guides
- Ensure code is runnable and tested
- Consider edge cases and error handling

#### References
- Include at least 2-3 references to related internal documents
- Add external references to authoritative sources
- Format links consistently: `[Link Text](../.venv/Lib/site-packages/pip/_vendor/urllib3/util/url.py)`

### 4. Submission Process
1. Create or update the file in the appropriate location
2. Update any related documents that should reference the new content
3. Update the changelog following [changelog standards](../meta/changelog_standards.md)
4. If creating a new directory or major content area, update [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

### 5. Review Process
All contributions undergo review as described in [Review Process](review_process.md)

## Style Guide

### Markdown Formatting
- Use `#` for main title (only one per document)
- Use `##` for main sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Use `####` for minor subsections
- Use backticks for inline code: `code`
- Use code blocks with language specification:
  ```python
  def example():
      return "formatted code"
  ```
- Use *italics* for emphasis
- Use **bold** for strong emphasis
- Use `>` for quotes and important notes

### Content Organization
- Start with an overview/introduction
- Group related concepts under clear headings
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps/instructions
- Use bullet points for non-sequential lists
- Include a references section at the end

## Document Metadata
- Include the following metadata at the end of each document:
  ```
  ## Metadata
  - **Author**: Your Name
  - **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
  - **Version**: X.Y.Z
  - **Tags**: tag1, tag2, tag3
  ```
